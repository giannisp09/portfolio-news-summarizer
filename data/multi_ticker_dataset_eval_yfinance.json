    "text": "Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:\n\nValue Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.\n\nIn any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick. One should analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.\n\nHowever, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance, a rise in market cap and a higher price-to-sales ratio.\n\nThe price-to-sales ratio is often preferred over price-to-earnings, as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.\n\nIf the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. A stock with a price-to-sales ratio below 1 is a good bargain, as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar\u2019s worth.\n\nWhile a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its price-to-sales can indicate the hidden strength of the business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure a company's growth is not overvalued.\n\nPCB Bancorp , G-III Apparel Group , Gibraltar Industries , Pfizer and Pampa Energia S.A. are some companies with low price-to-sales ratios and the potential to offer higher returns.\n\nInvesting in stocks based on valuation metrics is considered a smart strategy. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is often the go-to metric due to its simplicity and ease of use. However, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is more useful for evaluating stocks of companies that are unprofitable or in early growth stages, as it helps assess value when earnings are minimal or non-existent.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLos Angeles-based PCB Bancorp serves as the holding company for PCB Bank, offering a range of banking products and services tailored to small and medium-sized businesses, individuals, and professionals in Southern California. Its offerings include demand deposits, savings accounts, money market accounts, time deposits and certificates of deposit.\n\nPCB Bancorp also provides specialized services, such as trade finance, remote deposit capture, courier deposit services, positive pay, zero balance accounts and sweep accounts. The company\u2019s strategic expansion and branch network optimization position it for sustained balance sheet growth and strong financial performance. PCB has a Value Score of A and flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nG-III Apparel is a manufacturer, designer and distributor of apparel and accessories under licensed, owned and private-label brands. GIII has accelerated digital growth. It strives to become the best omnichannel organization, enhancing the DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris e-commerce platforms, and partnering with Amazon and Fanatics. Digital and omnichannel growth is a key priority.\n\nGIII\u2019s commitment to brand building, effective marketing, cost management and market expansion provides a solid foundation for continued growth and profitability in fiscal 2025 and beyond. The company's strategic initiatives leverage design and merchandising strengths to drive profitable sales growth through innovative products and collections. GIII Apparel currently has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nBuffalo, NY-based Gibraltar manufactures and distributes products to the industrial and building market. The products range from ventilation and expanded metal to mail storage solutions, rain dispersion products and solutions. ROCK has been benefiting from its focus on operational improvements and the Three-Pillar Strategy. The company continues to accelerate the implementation of three pillars through portfolio management initiatives, improvement of the business system and strengthening of the organization.\n\nGibraltar continues to accelerate its 80/20 initiatives in products and operations, optimizing the supply chain with market price actions. The company's focus on the 80/20 initiative has propelled its Residential segment\u2019s performance. Also, the high demand for agricultural facilities suggests a solid growth runway, especially for high-tech produce farms. ROCK currently has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nBased in New York, Pfizer markets a wide range of drugs and vaccines. The company\u2019s Biopharma reporting segment includes three broad therapeutic areas \u2014 Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology. PFE has committed significant resources toward developing treatments in oncology, internal medicine, rare diseases, immunology, inflammation, vaccines and hospitals.\n\nPfizer expects better non-COVID operational revenue growth in the upcoming quarters, driven by its products like Vyndaqel and Prevnar; launches like Abrysvo, Velsipity and Penbraya; and newly acquired products, including those acquired from Seagen. Huge profits from its COVID-19 products strengthened its cash position. PFE currently has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nPampa Energia is an independent energy-integrated company in Argentina. Through its subsidiaries, PAM is engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in Argentina. The company operates through Electricity Generation, Oil and Gas, Petrochemicals, and Holding and Other Business segments. It generates electricity through thermal generation plants, thermal gas-fired generation plants and hydroelectric power generation systems, as well as a wind farm.\n\nThe company also explores and produces oil and gas, and operates a high-voltage electricity transmission network.

    "cleaned_text": "Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening: Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank 1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space. In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick. One should analyze other ratios like Price Earnings, Price Book and Debt Equity before arriving at any investment decision. However, one should keep in mind that a company with high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance, a rise in market cap and a higher price-to-sales ratio. The price-to-sales ratio is often preferred over price-to-earnings, as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable. If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying 1 for every 1 of revenues generated by the company. A stock with a price-to-sales ratio below 1 is a good bargain, as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar s worth. While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its price-to-sales can indicate the hidden strength of the business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure a company's growth is not overvalued. PCB Bancorp , G-III Apparel Group , Gibraltar Industries , Pfizer and Pampa Energia S.A. are some companies with low price-to-sales ratios and the potential to offer higher returns. Investing in stocks based on valuation metrics is considered a smart strategy. The price-to-earnings P E ratio is often the go-to metric due to its simplicity and ease of use. However, the price-to-sales P S ratio is more useful for evaluating stocks of companies that are unprofitable or in early growth stages, as it helps assess value when earnings are minimal or non-existent. Story Continues Los Angeles-based PCB Bancorp serves as the holding company for PCB Bank, offering a range of banking products and services tailored to small and medium-sized businesses, individuals, and professionals in Southern California. Its offerings include demand deposits, savings accounts, money market accounts, time deposits and certificates of deposit. PCB Bancorp also provides specialized services, such as trade finance, remote deposit capture, courier deposit services, positive pay, zero balance accounts and sweep accounts. The company s strategic expansion and branch network optimization position it for sustained balance sheet growth and strong financial performance. PCB has a Value Score of A and flaunts a Zacks Rank 1 at present. You can see the complete list of today s Zacks 1 Rank stocks here. G-III Apparel is a manufacturer, designer and distributor of apparel and accessories under licensed, owned and private-label brands. GIII has accelerated digital growth. It strives to become the best omnichannel organization, enhancing the DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris e-commerce platforms, and partnering with Amazon and Fanatics.

GIII s commitment to brand building, effective marketing, cost management and market expansion provides a solid foundation for continued growth and profitability in fiscal 2025 and beyond. The company's strategic initiatives leverage design and merchandising strengths to drive profitable sales growth through innovative products and collections. GIII Apparel currently has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank 2. Buffalo, NY-based Gibraltar manufactures and distributes products to the industrial and building market. The products range from ventilation and expanded metal to mail storage solutions, rain dispersion products and solutions. ROCK has been benefiting from its focus on operational improvements and the Three-Pillar Strategy. The company continues to accelerate the implementation of three pillars through portfolio management initiatives, improvement of the business system and strengthening of the organization. Gibraltar continues to accelerate its 80 20 initiatives in products and operations, optimizing the supply chain with market price actions. The company's focus on the 80 20 initiative has propelled its Residential segment s performance. Also, the high demand for agricultural facilities suggests a solid growth runway, especially for high-tech produce farms. ROCK currently has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank 2. Based in New York, Pfizer markets a wide range of drugs and vaccines. The company s Biopharma reporting segment includes three broad therapeutic areas Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology. PFE has committed significant resources toward developing treatments in oncology, internal medicine, rare diseases, immunology, inflammation, vaccines and hospitals. Pfizer expects better non-COVID operational revenue growth in the upcoming quarters, driven by its products like Vyndaqel and Prevnar; launches like Abrysvo, Velsipity and Penbraya; and newly acquired products, including those acquired from Seagen. Huge profits from its COVID-19 products strengthened its cash position. PFE currently has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank 2.

    "finetuned_summary": "Baron Funds, an investment management company, released its Baron Technology Fund first quarter 2025 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. Market trends are often driven by sentiment in addition to fundamental elements, and the first quarter of 2025 was a clear example of this. January saw a strong performance for the Fund, driven by investor excitement around long-term growth trends in AI. Optimism was fueled by expectations of the new Trump administration's policies to accelerate economic growth. However, by mid-February, fears of tariffs, a potential trade war, and geopolitical shifts reversed market gains, leading to significant volatility."

For now, I rate AMD as a Hold.\n\nIn fact, analysts have recently revised their revenue and earnings expectations downwards , adding more pressure on the company\u2019s valuation. This valuation is only attractive if AMD can deliver significant growth, which remains uncertain.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been a disappointing stock over the past year, with declines accelerating in the last five months. Since May 2024, AMD has been down almost 32%. Amid growing concerns about demand for AI infrastructure chips, AMD has also struggled with a lack of competitiveness in absorbing that demand. Even after posting a beat across the board in its Q1 earnings last week and supplementing that with raised Q2 guidance, there are still no strong signs of a reversal in the bearish trend.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhat seems to be happening is a shift toward vertical integration by the hyperscalers. Big Tech companies are increasingly buying chips directly from manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD, and building AI systems in-house, bypassing integrators like SMCI and potentially leaving them on the sidelines.\n\nWhere AMD Stands in a Dynamic Chip Market\n\nDespite the broader trend of hyperscaler integration, the market remains skeptical about infrastructure chipmakers, especially AMD. There are some plausible reasons for that.\n\nFirst, even with persistent capex from hyperscalers, AMD is still struggling to capture that demand, as most of it continues to be funneled toward Nvidia GPUs, particularly the H100 and B200. While AMD is gaining some traction with its MI300 line, it still hasn\u2019t secured a significant share of the AI accelerator market.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) revenue, earnings and profit margin history\n\nThat\u2019s mainly because most of the current AI buildout is GPU-driven, rather than focused on traditional CPUs\u2014a segment that AMD still relies on heavily, especially for standard server deployments. With hyperscalers zeroing in on NVIDIA\u2019s GPU dominance, AMD is effectively left with pent-up demand, which it hasn\u2019t been able to unlock.\n\nAs a result, AMD continues to lag behind NVIDIA in absorbing the surging demand for AI infrastructure. The market has started to dial back expectations for AMD\u2019s growth, while also factoring in margin pressure stemming from the company\u2019s loss of competitiveness in the high-end AI segment.\n\nFollowing AMD\u2019s Q1 results, analysts revised revenue growth forecasts downward, trimming expectations for 2026 and 2027 by 0.3% and 1%, respectively. But the bigger hit came on the bottom line, with earnings estimates cut by 8% for 2025 and 3% for 2026.\n\nIs AMD\u2019s Valuation More De-Risked Now?\n\nTrading at 25x forward earnings, AMD is currently priced near the lowest levels seen in the last three years, having hit a low of 19x just a few weeks ago. That\u2019s a significant drop from its peak multiple of 63x in Q1 of last year\u2014a clear sign that some of the previous hype has been priced out.\n\nThis valuation only looks attractive if AMD manages to hit the current consensus EPS growth of 21.3% for FY2025. The issue is that recent earnings and ongoing concerns around AI demand have led to constant downward revisions, casting doubt on whether that growth target is realistic. So while the lower multiple suggests AMD could be de-risked enough to justify a bullish thesis, it also reflects investors\u2019 hesitation to pay a premium for its long-term story.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) vs. S&P 500 (SPY)\n\nThat said, if we zoom out and look at AMD\u2019s long-term EPS growth projections\u2014around 28.7% over the next 3 to 5 years\u2014the stock would be trading at a PEG ratio of 0.8x, which traditionally signals undervaluation. Still, it\u2019s hard to ignore that Nvidia, AMD\u2019s main competitor, trades at a PEG of just 0.2x, making it look even cheaper relative to growth.\n\nFor short-term traders looking to navigate AMD\u2019s high volatility, which amounts to around 45% annually, a more tactical approach is key. I suggest a strategy based on moving average crossovers\u2014specifically watching for a bullish signal when the 50-day MA crosses above the 200-day MA (the so-called Golden Cross). But, given AMD\u2019s price swings, it\u2019s crucial to only act on crossovers with a clear volume spike to confirm trend strength.\n\nThe chart below shows that the last major crossover occurred in October of last year, when the 50-day MA crossed below the 200-day\u2014a \u201cDeath Cross\u201d that triggered a sharp selloff in AMD\u2019s stock.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Technical Analysis\n\nWhat is the Price Target for AMD Stock?\n\nOverall, Wall Street is adamantly bullish on AMD stock. Of the 31 analysts covering the stock, 22 recommend a Buy, while another nine recommend a Hold. AMD\u2019s average price target is $125.24, which suggests a potential upside of almost 22% from the latest share price over the coming year.\n\nAMD Stuck in Neutral as Demand Ramps Up\n\nAMD recently posted a decent quarter, but it comes amid some paradoxes in the AI infrastructure chip market. The downward revisions to its long-term growth outlook highlight AMD\u2019s ongoing struggle to capitalize fully on AI demand, as Nvidia continues to dominate the high-performance GPU segment. In other words, the demand exists\u2014it\u2019s just not flowing to AMD at scale.\n\nWhile AMD\u2019s valuation may now appear more de-risked than in years, I would still wait for more explicit confirmation of a bullish trend before initiating a long position.\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nThe industry\u2019s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group\u2019s earnings growth potential.\n\nDespite the gloomy industry outlook, a few stocks are worth watching based on a strong earnings outlook. Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Lags Sector & S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Computer \u2013 Integrated Systems industry has underperformed the broader Computer and Technology sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite in the past year.\n\nThe industry has declined 3.7% over this period against the S&P 500 and the broader Computer and Technology sector\u2019s respective returns of 20.7% and 21%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of the trailing 12-month P/S, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer-integrated systems stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 3.69X compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 5.51X. It is also below the sector\u2019s trailing 12-month P/S of 6.85X.\n\nOver the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 5.27X and as low as 1.85X, with the median being at 2.78X.\n\n4 Computer-Integrated Systems Providers to Watch\n\nInternational Business Machines: IBM is experiencing robust revenue growth in its software division, primarily fueled by increasing hybrid cloud adoption and strong performance across RedHat, automation, data analytics, AI, and security solutions. The company's long-term trajectory is anchored in these three pillars as enterprises increasingly manage complex, heterogeneous cloud workloads, particularly with the proliferation of traditional cloud-native applications and generative AI deployments.\n\nThis complexity has driven organizations toward cloud-agnostic, interoperable approaches to multi-cloud management, directly benefiting IBM's hybrid cloud portfolio. IBM currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStrategic acquisitions have significantly enhanced IBM's market position.

    "text": "American Express is one of Berkshire's longest-standing holdings. Buffett purchased the stock for Berkshire in 1991 and has owned it since. American Express is likely not going anywhere as long as it is a financial staple in the world's largest economy.\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE: AXP) is a credit card company, bank, and payment processor with roots dating back to the 1800s. Today, the company is known for catering to high earners and businesses.\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly praised the U.S. economy over the years. The American consumer is the U.S. economy's beating heart. Credit cards can get borrowers into financial trouble, but debt is a cultural staple in a country with over $1.2 trillion in total credit card debt.\n\nApple, worth $3 trillion today, may not grow as it once did, but its staggering profitability and size enable jaw-dropping stock buybacks that set a pretty high floor for the stock.\n\nPeople depend on smartphones and other personal devices to communicate, surf the web, pay bills, and more. Apple's iOS ecosystem has become a juggernaut, with over 2.35 billion active devices worldwide. It's an ideal distribution channel through which Apple sells subscription services and collects fees on its App Store.\n\nBuffett has referred to personal electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as Berkshire's best business. Berkshire first bought the iPhone maker in 2016, and despite ringing the cash register a bit last year for a considerable profit, Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding. In Berkshire's latest shareholder meeting, Buffett even joked that Apple CEO Tim Cook, who personally attended the meeting, has made Berkshire more money than he ever did.\n\nBuffett is known for his long-term investment philosophies and willingness to hold winning stocks, even if they become significant portions of his portfolio. Just four winning stocks make up 57% of Berkshire Hathaway's $277 billion stock portfolio. Here they are, and why they are still excellent buy-and-hold candidates for any long-term investor.\n\nWarren Buffett capped a legendary career recently when he announced that he would be stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year. The multibillionaire and all-time investing great spent six decades leading the holding company to success, which grew into one of the world's largest companies.\n\nHis long-term mindset has led Berkshire Hathaway to buy and hold several winners.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company's management has also noted success in winning over Gen Z and millennial consumers, who will carry the mantle of American consumerism over the coming decades. That makes the stock a no-brainer to buy and hold.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool\n\n3. Bank of America: Current value of Berkshire's stake: $28.4 billion\n\nBuffett allegedly came up with the idea to invest in America's second-largest bank, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), while soaking in the bathtub.\n\nBerkshire struck a deal to buy preferred shares and stock warrants in 2011, ultimately cashing in and building a position in common shares in 2017. A bank stock like Bank of America, which has over $3.3 trillion in total assets, offers broad exposure to the economy because Bank of America deals in everything from commercial real estate to financial markets and mortgages.\n\nIt's worth noting that Bank of America may not be for everyone because bank stocks are sensitive to interest rates and recessions. Additionally, the reason Buffett's Bank of America investment worked out so well is primarily because he negotiated a deal that few individual investors would realistically have the ability or resources to do.\n\nStill, Buffett has continued to hold Bank of America as one of Berkshire's most prominent holdings, a clear vote of confidence that helps it stand out among other banks.\n\n4. Coca-Cola: Current value of Berkshire's stake: $28.2 billion\n\nGlobal beverage behemoth Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is arguably the most famous Warren Buffett stock. There are countless photos of Buffett enjoying Coca-Cola products over the years. Berkshire first bought the stock in 1988, and it has been a model of consistency for the portfolio.\n\nIt's not the fastest-growing company you can invest in, but it has steadily grown for generations. Coca-Cola is a Dividend King with 62 consecutive annual dividend raises. Berkshire's stake pays out over $800 million in dividends annually!\n\nWill that stop anytime soon? Don't count on it. Coca-Cola doesn't grow very fast, but it has virtually endless growth opportunities in a global economy with over 8 billion people. The beverage market is highly fragmented, so Coca-Cola can launch new products or acquire emerging competitors when needed.\n\nAdd it all up, and Coca-Cola is the tortoise that will slowly make you rich if you buy and hold it for decades, as Buffett and Berkshire have done.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

Two are even paying over 9%.\n\nHow \u201csafe\u201d are these dividends?\n\nSome of these 5 companies have paid a dividend for decades, but that is no guarantee that they will continue to pay in the future. Walgreens Boots Alliance paid a dividend for over 90 years before finally eliminating it.\n\nWhat should income investors know about high dividend yield stocks?\n\n5 Stocks with Mega-High Dividend Yields\n\n1. Whirlpool Corp. WHR\n\nWhirlpool, a home appliance company, has been paying a quarterly dividend since at least 1989. That included during the bust of the housing bubble from 2008 to 2012. Shares of Whirlpool have tumbled over the last 5 years and are trading near 5-year lows. It\u2019s down 32.3% compared to the S&P 500 which is up 92% in that period.\n\nWhirlpool is committed to the dividend. It is paying a quarterly dividend of $1.75, payable on June 15, 2025 for shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 16, 2025. That dividend is yielding 9.1%.\n\nIs Whirlpool\u2019s massive dividend safe?\n\n2. Pfizer Inc. PFE\n\nPfizer, the giant pharmaceutical company, has not cut its dividend since 2009, when it bought Wyeth. Shares of Pfizer have tumbled over the last 5 years, falling 33.5%. In 2025, the weakness continued, with shares down 11.9% year-to-date.\n\nPfizer\u2019s dividend now yielding 7.2%. It is paying $1.72 annually. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is looking for 2025 earnings of $3.07.\n\nIs Pfizer\u2019s juicy dividend safe?\n\n3. Chevron Corp. CVX\n\nChevron, the American Big Oil company, is a dividend aristocrat. It has raised its dividend 38 years in a row. And Chevron hasn\u2019t cut its dividend since 1934, which was during the Great Depression.",

Sign up here.Most Read from BloombergA New Central Park Amenity, Tailored to Its East Harlem NeighborsAs Trump Reshapes Housing Policy, Renters Face Rollback of RightsIs Trump\u2019s Plan to Reopen the Notorious Alcatraz Prison Realistic?What\u2019s Behind the Rise in Serious Injuries on New York City\u2019s Streets?NYC Warns of 17% Drop in Foreign Tourists Due to Trump PoliciesToyota Motor Corp. is the biggest carmaker in the world \u2014",
    "text": "Japan\u2019s chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said on April 30 that one unnamed Japanese automaker is currently losing around $1 million per hour from the tariffs, citing a calculation made by an unidentified corporate executive. A Japanese government official on Friday declined to provide more specifics. But that rate of loss isn\u2019t too far off the mark from the $1.2 billion hit Toyota is projecting based on 730 hours per month. Representatives for Toyota also didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to tariffs, the details are still incredibly fluid,\u201d Toyota\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Koji Sato, said last week after releasing the latest financial results. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to take steps or measure the impact.\u201d\n\nThe huge tariff hit reflects the company\u2019s decision to hold the line on sticker prices at US dealers and production volumes at its 11 American factories amid the start of bilateral trade negotiations between the US and Japan. Those talks started in February and it\u2019s unclear when they will conclude with a deal.\n\nWhile Toyota has increased local production in the US to more than half of sales in the country, it still relies on imports of key vehicle parts and models \u2014 to the tune of some 1.2 million cars a year. The White House has noticed, with Trump calling out the Toyota City-based automaker by name during his contentious Liberation Day speech in the Rose Garden on April 2. He complained about Toyota\u2019s \u201cone million foreign made automobiles\u201d sold in the US.\n\nDuties on imported cars and auto parts forced General Motors Co. to slash its full-year profit guidance by as much as $5 billion, while Ford Motor Co. is bracing for a $1.5 billion annual hit. Toyota sees a $1.2 billion profit drop in just two months. While the Japanese automaker didn\u2019t provide a tally for all of 2025, it did project operating income of \u00a53.8 trillion ($26.1 billion) for the fiscal year ending March 2026 \u2014 far below the \u00a54.7 trillion expected by analysts.\n\nToyota Motor Corp. is the biggest carmaker in the world \u2014 and also the auto industry\u2019s biggest loser when it comes to projected losses from US President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAkazawa has expressed hope that an agreement could be reached in June with the next round of negotiations taking place in late May.\n\nMost imported vehicles became subject to a 25% US duty on April 3, while most auto parts become subject to that levy as of May 3. There are some executive orders that prevent duties from doubling up, but considering the US is the biggest market for Japan\u2019s five largest carmakers, even a moderately increase in tariffs will have an outsized impact on their bottom lines.\n\nThe Trump administration reached its first trade deal on May 8 with the UK. But the US had a $11.9 billion goods trade surplus with the UK last year, whereas it ran a $68.5 billion deficit with Japan. That may make it more difficult to secure an agreement without significant concessions by one side.\n\n\u201cThe hurdle is high for Japan to get auto tariffs lowered\u201d on exports to the US, said Hiroshi Namioka, chief strategist at T&D Asset Management Co. \u201cAt the same time, the auto industry is too important for Japan to simply go along with what the US wants.\u201d\n\nSome Japanese automakers have responded to the tough new trade environment by making changes to their global manufacturing footprints. Nissan Motor Co. halted US orders for SUVs built in Mexico while Honda Motor Co. is shifting production of the hybrid version of its Civic from Japan to the US. Due to retaliatory tariffs against the US, Mazda Motor Co. is stopping exports to Canada of one model that\u2019s manufactured at an Alabama factory that\u2019s a joint venture with Toyota.\n\n\u201cWe will maintain our current operations while continuing to focus on reducing fixed costs, all while keeping a close eye on the movements by U.S. authorities, including customs duties,\u201d a spokesperson for Toyota said in a statement.\n\nJapan Production Pledge\n\nToyota has already invested heavily to build out its US operations \u2014 including spending $13.9 billion on a new battery plant in North Carolina. But it also remains committed to maintaining its extensive domestic production base. Chairman Akio Toyoda has repeatedly pledged to keep making at least three million vehicles a year in Japan. Last year, the company built 3.1 million cars in its home country, about a third of its worldwide production total.\n\nGlobally, Toyota sold 10.8 million cars in 2024, with the US accounting for a little less than a quarter of those. While half were made locally and another 30% came from neighboring Canada and Mexico, some 281,000 vehicles were imported from Japan. That includes popular models such as the 4Runner mid-sized SUV, Prius hybrid and several upscale Lexus vehicles.\n\nThe company\u2019s best-sellers in the US \u2014 the RAV4 hybrid crossover and Corolla compact sedan \u2014 are assembled at factories in Kentucky and Mississippi. But gas-only RAV4s are imported from Canada and the plug-in hybrid comes from Japan. Corolla models variants like the sporty GR, practical hatchback and gas-electric hybrid also carry made-in-Japan labels.\n\nThat exposure puts Toyota in the crosshairs of the Trump administration and means the automaker has a lot riding on the outcome of the US-Japan trade negotiations.\n\nThe carmaker has quietly pushed back on the White House\u2019s critique, noting through a spokesman that it\u2019s committed to spend almost $21 billion in the US just since 2020. That\u2019s nearly double the pledge it made during Trump\u2019s first administration \u2014 after similarly coming under attack by the US president.

    "cleaned_text": "Japan s chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said on April 30 that one unnamed Japanese automaker is currently losing around 1 million per hour from the tariffs, citing a calculation made by an unidentified corporate executive. A Japanese government official on Friday declined to provide more specifics. But that rate of loss isn t too far off the mark from the 1.2 billion hit Toyota is projecting based on 730 hours per month. Representatives for Toyota also didn t respond to a request for comment. When it comes to tariffs, the details are still incredibly fluid, Toyota s Chief Executive Officer, Koji Sato, said last week after releasing the latest financial results. It s difficult to take steps or measure the impact. The huge tariff hit reflects the company s decision to hold the line on sticker prices at US dealers and production volumes at its 11 American factories amid the start of bilateral trade negotiations between the US and Japan. Those talks started in February and it s unclear when they will conclude with a deal. While Toyota has increased local production in the US to more than half of sales in the country, it still relies on imports of key vehicle parts and models to the tune of some 1.2 million cars a year. The White House has noticed, with Trump calling out the Toyota City-based automaker by name during his contentious Liberation Day speech in the Rose Garden on April 2. He complained about Toyota s one million foreign made automobiles sold in the US. Duties on imported cars and auto parts forced General Motors Co. to slash its full-year profit guidance by as much as 5 billion, while Ford Motor Co. is bracing for a 1.5 billion annual hit.

The platform also matches advertiser demand with publisher supply, helping advertisers maximize the return on their advertising spend. So far, the results have been superb.\n\nProtect Your Portfolio Against Market Uncertainty\n\nAppLovin (APP) price history year-to-date\n\nEarlier this week, AppLovin published its Q1 2025 earnings, boasting about AXON\u2019s growth and operating leverage. Advertising revenue grew 71% year-over-year to $1.16 billion in the first quarter, with AppLovin going \u201call in\u201d on digital advertising. Moreover, the tech company recently announced its intention to sell its less profitable and declining mobile gaming business for $400 million in cash, while still maintaining a 20% equity stake. The confluence of factors makes me cautiously bullish on APP stock.\n\nAppLovin\u2019s Strategic Exit from Mobile Gaming\n\nFor those unfamiliar, AppLovin\u2019s AXON platform marks an evolution from its mobile gaming origins, leveraging AI to deliver real-time data analysis and highly efficient ad targeting. Unlike traditional ads in newspapers, TV, or billboards, where reach was broad but untargeted, today\u2019s digital landscape enables precise targeting. AXON capitalizes on this shift with predictive algorithms and a self-learning loop that continuously refines its models, creating a flywheel effect: the more data it processes, the smarter and more effective it gets.\n\nEarly results show that AXON resonates with customers. In Q1, AppLovin\u2019s advertising segment posted $943 million in adjusted EBITDA, an impressive 80% margin, meaning 80 cents of every dollar flows straight to the bottom line. Free cash flow reached $826 million, a robust 55% margin even by software standards. Further underscoring its pivot, AppLovin sold its mobile gaming business for $400 million, betting big on AXON\u2019s future.\n\nAppLovin (APP) revenue, earnings and profit margin history\n\nLooking ahead, the company projects sequential growth in Q2, with ad revenue expected to hit ~1.2 billion and an 81% adjusted EBITDA margin. Despite these strong numbers, AppLovin is just starting to grab share in the broader ad market, with plans to expand into web advertising and beyond.\n\nValuation and Competitive Risks\n\nAppLovin\u2019s stellar numbers have propelled it into the ranks of leading tech players, now boasting a market cap in excess of $100 billion. But with that success comes sky-high expectations. The stock trades at a P/E ratio of 67 \u2014 nearly three times the sector median \u2014 signaling that investors are pricing in near-flawless execution and continued strong performance. As AppLovin\u2019s market share grows, sustaining its rapid pace will inevitably get tougher.",

And they were like, 'Uh, maybe.

This led to a panicked pause while they waited for customers to return the frames so the company could ship them to other prospective customers.\n\n\"We suspended our home try-on program because all the glasses were out with customers,\" Blumenthal said. \"We had to wait for them to come back. People started calling up and saying, 'Hey, I want to try on your glasses, they're not available for home try-on.' And so we said, 'Well, if you want, you can come to my apartment.'\"",

Headline growth came in at 5.2%, slightly lower due to fewer special dividends and a stronger US dollar.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The company has a solid long-term strategy in motion, aiming to broaden its business beyond its core strength in smartphones. It is expanding into new areas like PC processors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A key area of potential growth lies in industrial automation, where Qualcomm plans to leverage its mobile technology experience to bring AI capabilities to manufacturing systems.\n\nQUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) reported strong earnings in its fiscal Q2 2025. The company posted revenue of $10.8 billion, which showed a 15.4% growth from the same period last year. The revenue surpassed analysts\u2019 estimates of $178.6 million.

The company ended the quarter with $7.2 billion available in cash and cash equivalents. It also generated $7.1 billion in operating cash flow.

By the same token, K\u00e4llenius said the company will not restore the financial outlook it withdrew several weeks ago amid the uncertainty.\n\n\"What we have decided to do in this current environment is to send a signal of stability towards our customers, but also our business partners,\" K\u00e4llenius said. \"And we will see how things develop. We are in the position that we don't have to make hasty decisions on things like that [price increases], and we won't. So I don't want to pull out the crystal ball now and say what's the world going to look like six months from now, but our priority for the US market will be long-term growth, taking care of our great customer base.\"\n\nThe Trump administration tossed a small bone to global automakers several weeks ago, moving to relax some of the 25% tariffs slapped on autos and auto parts.\n\nThe new executive order allows car companies to be reimbursed for up to 3.75% of the value of US-assembled vehicles to help offset the cost of tariffs in year one. In year two, the rebate would be 2.5%, before phasing out in year three.\n\nRead more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\n\nMore than half of the 374,000 vehicles Mercedes-Benz sold in the US last year were imported, according to the company. About 13% of German car exports go to the United States, more than to any other country, according to data from the German auto association VDA.\n\nK\u00e4llenius added that Mercedes will start producing its top-selling GLC SUV at its plant in Tuscaloosa, Ala., in a bid to produce locally and sidestep some tariffs.\n\nAmid the challenging backdrop, Mercedes-Benz said in late April that first quarter profits fell 43% from a year ago to 1.73 billion euros. Revenue declined 7.4% year over year to 33.22 billion euros.\n\nThe company's car sales declined 4% in the first quarter. While sales in North America advanced 1%, a 7% decline in Europe and a 10% decrease in China overshadowed the minor gain.\n\n\"No,\" K\u00e4llenius said regarding whether guidance will be restored as more clarity on tariffs has been received. \"We decided in our quarter one call to say this is a situation where it almost feels like there's new information every day, or certainly every week, that if you don't have to change your mind four times in a month, it doesn't make any sense.\"",

    "text": "Amid the headwinds and uncertainties, Jones has positioned his portfolio to benefit from any bounce back once the selloff dust settles. Jones, who shot to fame on profiting from the 1987 market crash, has etched his name on Wall Street owing to his extraordinary ability to foresee market shifts and try to capitalize on them.\n\nThe tariff war has put the US central bank in a tight spot as it tries to balance interest rates amid a tariff war likely to spark inflation. The US Federal Reserve has had to keep its key overnight lending rate steady since December, on growing concerns that the trade war will trigger a significant spike in inflation. Fed chair Jerome Powell, insisting that policymakers wait for greater clarity, has not only rattled the markets but also triggered a backlash from the US president.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll dial it back to 50% or 40%, whatever. Even when he does that ... it\u2019d be the largest tax increases since the \u201960s,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSo you can kind of take 2%, 3% off growth.\u201d\n\nThe remarks come on Trump slapping 145% tariffs on imported Chinese goods as one of the ways of getting Beijing into the negotiation table. While the administration has hinted at the possibility of dialing it back to about 50% or 40%, Jones insists it will be too little too late.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s pretty clear. You have Trump who\u2019s locked in on tariffs. You have the Fed who\u2019s locked in on not cutting rates. That\u2019s not good for the stock market,\u201d Jones said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll probably go down to new lows, even when Trump dials back China to 50%.\u201d\n\nThe hedge fund manager insists stocks are bound to hit new lows even on Trump toning down on aggressive tariffs on China. That\u2019s because macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate.\n\nIt\u2019s all gloomy regardless of what US President Donald Trump does. That\u2019s the sentiment echoed by billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones, who is taking issue with the aggressive tariffs aimed at settling the trade deficit between the US and its trading partners. While the US markets have pulled back by up to 8% in response to the tariff war woes, Jones believes the dust is unlikely to settle anytime soon.\n\nWe recently published an article titled Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' 10 Stocks Picks with Huge Upside Potential . In this article, we are going to take a look at where Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against Paul Tudor Jones' other stock picks with huge upside potential.\n\nStory Continues\n\nJones has constantly reiterated the need to concentrate on risk management and protecting current investments during heightened market volatility. Instead of daydreaming about possible gains, he advises investors to spend 90% of their time considering the cash at risk in their investments.\n\n\u201cPeople need to focus on the money that they have at risk and how much capital is at risk in any single investment they have. If everyone spent 90% of their time on that, not 90% of the time on pie-in-the-sky ideas of how much money they're going to make, then they would be incredibly successful investors,\u201d Jones said.\n\nTudor Investment Corporation, founded in 1980, is the investment firm that the hedge fund manager uses to pursue opportunities in the equity markets while leveraging solid risk management strategies. The firm has generated an average return of 19% over the years, affirming a solid stock-picking strategy. With that, let's take a look at the firm's top stock picks with huge upside potential.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe combed Tudor Investment Corporation Q4 2024 13F filings to identify Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' 10 Stocks Picks with Huge Upside Potential. We then settled on stocks with more than 30% upside potential based on analysts ratings and analyzed why the stocks stand out, as solid value investments well poised to generate significant long term value. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the stocks upside potential (as of May 7). We have also mentioned the broader hedge fund sentiment for these stocks, as of Q4 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAdobe Inc.

Jones insists stocks are bound to hit new lows even on Trump toning down on aggressive tariffs on China. The US markets have pulled back by up to 8 in response to the tariff war woes, but Jones believes the dust is unlikely to settle anytime soon. Jones has positioned his portfolio to benefit from any bounce back once the selloff dust settles.",

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries. Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.

    "text": "Thank you, Abby, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the quarter, let me start by saying how excited I am to be with you today on my first call as CEO. Since we announced our leadership succession in January, I've had the opportunity to spend time with many stakeholders, including our customers, investors, regulators and Duke Energy teammates. These conversations centered around the same theme, the critical role Duke Energy plays in powering the lives of our communities and serving the incredible power demand facing the nation. We are projecting low growth at levels I've never seen in my 30-year career, which will drive more than a decade of record infrastructure build. We are ready to meet the moment with a renewed focus on speed and agility and supported by the same spirit of innovation that has been at the heart of this company for over a century. As I assumed the CEO role during this pivotal point for our company and industry, Duke Energy's mission remains unchanged. Delivering long-term value for shareholders and superior service to our customers and communities by building a smarter energy future. Moving to the quarterly results. Today, we announced first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.76, which marks a strong start to the year. These results were $0.32 above last year. driven top line growth across our electric and gas utilities. The constructive regulatory outcomes we've delivered over the last several years provide line of sight to earnings growth with minimized rate case exposure in 2025 and 2026. We remain confident in our outlook and are reaffirming our 2025 guidance range of $6.17 to $6.42, and our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2029. Moving to slide 5. Meeting our customers' growing and evolving energy demands requires not only new generation but where possible, maintaining and enhancing our existing generation. In March, we received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend the operating license for our Oconee nuclear station for an additional 20 years. With three generating units that produce more than 2,600 megawatts, Oconee is our first nuclear station to reach this milestone and will now power the Carolinas into the 2050s. As the operator of the largest regulated fleet in the nation, nuclear is foundational to our strategy, and we intend to seek similar extensions for each of our remaining reactors to extend their respective licensing periods. In addition to extending the life of our nuclear fleet, we continue to pursue upgrade projects to efficiently increase the capacity of existing natural gas, nuclear and hydro units. Individually, these are small, ranging less than 10 megawatts up to 75 megawatts per unit. But in aggregate, they represent over 1 gigawatt of cost-effective incremental capacity to support our growing regions. Turning to new generation. We've taken several important steps this year to advance our all-of-the-above strategy to meet growing demand and replace aging infrastructure. In the Carolinas, we commenced early site activities for our first combined cycle unit in Person County, and we filed a CPCN for a second combined cycle at the site. In Indiana, we filed CPCNs for two combined cycles in February. In Florida, we're making investments in solar and battery storage projects approved in our multiyear rate plan. In January, we joined a public private DOE grant application led by TVA to explore new nuclear technologies. The coalition has the potential to accelerate SMR technology development and increase our access to industry learnings and best practices. And finally, we recently announced a strategic partnership with GE Vernova to secure up to 19 natural gas turbines. This agreement provides for timely delivery of critical infrastructure to meet our enterprise-wide resource plans, and serve the growing needs of our customers into the 2030s. Moving to slide 6. We continue to work closely with regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders to advance regulatory and legislative priorities across our jurisdictions. In the Carolinas, we've had ongoing discussions with stakeholders in both states around merging our DC and DEP utilities. We are on track to file a merger application later this year with North Carolina and South Carolina commissions as well as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The proposed merger would create significant customer savings, simplify operations and regulatory processes and add operational flexibility to our system. We expect the application process to take about a year and are targeting January 2027 for the effective date of the merger. We also continue to advance storm securitization in North and South Carolina, and we're on track to issue securitization bonds in both states by the end of this year. Turning to Florida. In March, we began recovering 2024 hurricane costs over 12 months. The timely recovery of storm costs was a key objective into the year. And this constructive outcome supports our commitment to a strong balance sheet. Finally, our Kentucky Electric rate case is progressing with hearings scheduled for later this month, and we expect to implement new rates later this year. I am incredibly proud of our strong performance in the first quarter, which is a result of continued operational excellence and the constructive outcomes the team has delivered. The fundamentals of the company are stronger than ever and provide visibility growth for years to come. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian.\n\nThank you, Sammy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's first-quarter 2025 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Harry Sideris, President and CEO; along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Harry.\n\nHello everyone, and thank you for joining the Duke Energy first-quarter 2025 earnings call. My name is [Sammy] and I'll be coordinating your call today. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to hand over to your host, Abby Motsinger, VP, Investor relations to begin. Please go ahead, Abby.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nThanks, Harry, and good morning, everyone. Moving to slide 7. We delivered a strong first quarter with reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.76, a 22% increase over the first quarter of 2024. Within the segments, Electric Utilities & Infrastructure was up $0.33 compared to last year. Growth was driven by higher sales volumes, improved weather and the implementation of new rates partially offsetting these items were higher interest expense and depreciation.\n\nMoving to Gas, Utilities and Infrastructure. results were up $0.08 compared to last year, driven by new rates at Piedmont, North Carolina. And finally, the other segment was down $0.08, primarily due to higher interest expense. Overall, we are very pleased with the first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations and reflect the strength of the regulatory outcomes and operational performance we have consistently delivered.\n\nTurning to slide 8. Weather-normal volumes increased 1.8% versus last year, in line with our full-year projection of 1.5% to 2%. Residential volumes were up over 3% in the quarter. reflecting both customer growth and higher usage. We continue to see robust customer growth through the first quarter, concentrated in the Southeast and Indiana.\n\nAs we look ahead, we continue to expect load growth to accelerate beginning in 2027 as economic development projects come online. Our economic development pipeline continues to grow and includes advanced manufacturing projects across multiple sectors as well as data centers.\n\nWe're streamlining processes across the organization to accelerate projects through the pipeline, which is yielding results. In April, we signed new letter agreements for nearly 1 gigawatt of data center projects and advanced manufacturing projects continue to ramp. The pipeline remains robust. And we continue to take a risk-adjusted approach as we evaluate which projects to include in our forecast.\n\nTurning to slide 9. As we've demonstrated over many years, our commitment to our current credit ratings and a strong balance sheet will remain a top priority as we execute our growth objectives. We are delivering on all credit supportive initiatives and are firmly on track to achieve 14% FFO to debt this year, and we expect to improve above 14% over the five-year plan. This provides over 100 basis points of cushion above our Moody's downgrade threshold and over 200 basis points above our S&P downgrade threshold.\n\nAs we disclosed in February, we expect to issue $1 billion of common equity this year via our DRIP and ATM programs. In the first quarter, we took advantage of a strong market pricing just over $530 million, more than half of our annual target. We've also completed close to 40% of our planned long-term debt issuances for 2025, and are on track to receive storm securitization proceeds by the end of the year in the Carolinas.\n\nBefore I close, let me take a moment to talk about progress on our capital plan. We're continuing to advance our grid improvement plans. And as Harry highlighted, we're investing in our existing fleet and hitting a new gear in building generation. We invested more than $3 billion of capital in the quarter, and we're on track for $15 billion for the full year. As we think about our capital plan going forward, we're evaluating the impact of tariffs.\n\nIt's important to remember that tariffs primarily affect capital, and the majority of our capital spend is American labor, which is not subject to tariffs. We currently estimate the impact of tariffs to be about 1% to 3% of our five-year capital plan. And we are confident in our ability to further minimize the impact leveraging our size and scale to work with suppliers across our diverse supply chain.\n\nMoving to slide 10. We remain confident in delivering our 2025 earnings guidance range of $6.17 to $6.42 and 5% to 7% earnings growth through 2029. We with the potential to earn the top half of the range as load growth accelerates in the back end of the plan.\n\nOur track record of constructive regulatory outcomes provides a solid foundation and minimizes near-term regulatory exposure in our financial plan. We are well positioned to achieve our growth targets, which combined with our attractive dividend yield, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders.\n\nWith that, we'll open the line for your questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nThank you very much. (Operator Instructions)\n\nShahriar Pourreza, Guggenheim Partners.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nHey guys, good morning.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nGood morning, Shar.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nMorning. Just I guess, first, it's -- obviously, it's been reaffirmed, but you're seeing, obviously, a fairly strong step-up in '27. You're signing more letters of agreements, '27 isn't that far off. I guess at what point could we start seeing some guideposts around incremental CapEx opportunities above your base plan like some of your peers have been doing.\n\nSo range of maybe possible upside CapEx opportunities that can go into plan as more deals are signed. I guess, are you considering this type of placeholder disclosure and could EEI be the podium for that? Thanks.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nYeah. Thanks for that, Shar. I'll start off and turn it over to Brian for any feedback he has on it as well. So we just updated our plan in February, as you know, $83 billion for the next five years, half of that going into the grid, half of it for a generation build.\n\nWe got several updates coming up with our IRP in the Carolinas being updated. We continue to work our pipeline. It's stable and growing, and as that continues and our updates to our IRP never say that order. We will continue to look at our plans, but we do have a wealth of investment opportunities and growth opportunities, and we'll continue to look at that and update you as that comes along.\n\nAnd Brian, do you have anything to add?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nYeah, I would add, we're updating our resource plans, and we just actually filed our 10-year site plan in Florida, which calls for more resources than our previous plan. And Shar, we've kind of gotten on this annual cycle of updating capital in February.\n\nIf there is a catalyst, we will definitely update the investment community. But until then, I would kind of look to February as our major capital update cycle, but we take all these things into consideration when we update.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nOkay. Got it. And then just maybe a question for Brian. Just on credit metrics, I mean, obviously, the key thing is the visibility is improving. You guys are monetizing the tax credit you're getting storm cost recoveries.\n\nI guess when can we start seeing some more specificity around actual target ranges within the plan versus the 100 basis points, 200 basis guidance you guys have been out there for some time. Is there a point when you can start to disclose around actual ranges you guys decide to -- you can land that during the trajectory? Thanks.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nI appreciate the question, Shar. And it's something that we've been discussing a lot internally as we've continued to improve the credit profile of Duke and growing the operating cash flow and clearing some of these items that are in front of us like storm recovery and storm securitization. So I think we're going to continue to evaluate it, but we'll see this within maybe our next cycle in February, we'll give a more defined targeted range on where we would be on the credit.\n\nShahriar Pourreza\n\nOkay. That was actually my question. I appreciate that. Thanks, guys.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith, Jefferies.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nHey, good morning team. Thank you guys very much for the time. Hey, pleasure. Hey guys, just to follow up a little bit on what Shar have said. Picking at here. I mean 1 gigawatt of signed deals in April alone, quite a statement there.\n\nJust how are you thinking about the statement with respect to the cadence that you had contemplated? I mean, obviously, as you say, you've seen this accelerated load growth, but is it actually accelerating actively versus what you guys did contemplated initially.\n\nMaybe I'm not asking specifically about the CapEx, but just in terms of the cadence of adding a single gigawatt in a single month of data center deals specifically, I mean, are you seeing more than what you even talked about back in February? Or maybe another way to ask that is, where are you within that range of the 3% to 4% that you laid out just a handful of months ago as you see these data points coming in?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nYeah, Julien. Our pipeline continues to be robust and continues to grow. And we've really focused on accelerating getting projects through what we call our funnel to get them from the pipeline through these letter agreement stages to shore them up. So this 1 gigawatt that we just signed is working through our process. It's been contemplated in our plans.\n\nAnd we'll continue to work that large pipeline that we have to move more of these through our funnel to look at how we go to in the future. So we feel very comfortable and confident that we have a great pipeline, and we continue to find ways to work through that faster for our customers.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nGot it. Understood. And then if I can pivot slight differently. I mean big announcement the other day with your friends at [GV] here. How do you think about the '19 turbine commitments, I mean, just against what you guys have in the plan.\n\nHow do you think about that juxtaposing versus what's formal in the plan versus what's possible here again, I know that it's not a formal commitment on your side per se, but just curious how that fits and what that might suggest about future activities and future generation needs?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nWe were very pleased with the partnership with GE. We talked about meeting the moment at Duke and serving the tremendous load growth that we have ahead of us, and innovative agreements and framework agreements like this gives us the flexibility as we're moving projects through that funnel, that we're able to have the supply chain shored up in terms of turbines and other agreements that we have so that we could quickly serve these customers as they want to come on. So this is important to shore up and give us the flexibility as we move these projects into fruition that we're able to deliver them to the customer quickly because that's what they want. So these agreements are great.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nGot it. Excellent. In '25 seems like you're trending well already. I mean, too early to talk about, shall we say, moving within the range, but how do you think about putting more latitude against shoring up where you are against the longer-term outlook, just even '26 here in derisking some of the future years?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nYeah. Julien, I think we look at our five-year plan and our 5% to 7% growth and feel very good about that growth outlook. And good start to '25 obviously helps every year in front of it. So we think that 2026 planning has been underway for many months now as we think about the years ahead, and we're well positioned to deliver on that growth range as we look at the plan.\n\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith\n\nGreat, guys. Alright, thank you so much.\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nThank you.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nDurgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI Group.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nGood morning team. Thank you for giving me time. Congrats Harry, once again. (multiple speakers) you guys have discussed the DEP and DEC merger in the past. Maybe just a little bit more color, what are the financial implications of that merger, when approved cost savings? I know there's going to be some operations streamlining. But just any color you can share there would be appreciated.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nYes, sir, yes. We're excited about the opportunity to merge our DEC and DEP utilities, something we've contemplated since the merger back in 2012. Stakeholders are very supportive of this. It does generate a lot of savings over time for our customers over $1 billion. So that will help with the affordability to our rates for our customers going forward.\n\nIt really focuses on operational savings, fuel savings from running a combined system, managing our reserve margins as a whole instead of separately allowing us to put plants in the best location and optimize that. It's less regulatory proceedings, which are regulators like as well as us.\n\nSo it continues to provide a lot of benefits for our customers. So we continue to work with our stakeholders on finalizing the details. Like I mentioned earlier, we plan to file later this summer with the North Carolina and South Carolina commissions as well as FERC and look to be running as one utility in January of 2027.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nGot it. Okay. Sounds like a ton of room for making improvements on the customer front. Great. Just one quick follow-up on the data center, 1 gigawatt signing. Can you just size how many customers is that? Just trying to get a flavor for, are these one or two large customers or just the megawatts per customer, if you will? Thank you.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nYeah. The 1 gigawatt we talk about is actually two customers.\n\nDurgesh Chopra\n\nOkay. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nCarly Davenport, Goldman Sachs.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nHey, good morning, thank you for taking my question. (multiple speakers) -- good morning, thank you for taking my question. maybe just to start, [IRP] has been pretty topical throughout earnings season here as we look at some of the potential legislation coming through reconciliations.\n\nCan you just provide your latest views on the outlook both for transferability and the future of the tax credits that support a lot of these renewables projects? And can you just remind us in terms of what is actually baked into the financial plan from a transferability perspective?\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nYeah, I'll take that one, Carly. We appreciate the -- what Congress has ahead of them and how many priorities they'll be weighing as they work through the budget reconciliation process. We tend to look at this from the customers' perspective, and really our overarching objective is to maintain affordability for our customers, and that's what we've framed our advocacy around.\n\nThe savings our customers receive from these energy credits fall right in line to what the President wants to do, which is delivering on this promise to reduce power bills across the country. As you know, each one of these dollars that we earn in energy tax credits goes back to our customers.\n\nThe nuclear tax credits are most important to us. Our well-run, low-cost nuclear plants earn over $500 billion of tax credits that go directly to reducing our customers' bills. Nuclear has broad support in Washington. And we were pleased to see last week 26 representative sign a letter, stressing the importance of the nuclear tax credit and transferability to the President's objective of affordable and reliable energy. So we continue to work with folks in Washington to advocate to help our customers lower their bills, reduce credits, and we will continue to do that as they work through the process.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nGreat. I appreciate that. And then maybe just as we think about the macro, is there anything that you're seeing or hearing from, in particular, your industrial customer base in terms of activity levels potentially being impacted by a higher degree of economic and policy uncertainty at this point?\n\nBrian Savoy\n\nIt's obviously the topic everyone is talking about, Carly, and we're in close communication with our large customers as we always are. And we've not seen any changes to their production schedules or expectations for '25.\n\nBut I would say, there's somewhat of a cautionary stance, right? Because (inaudible) everybody is waiting for the finalization of where the tariff policies might land and their inputs reliance on the global supply chain, all factor into that equation. So I would say that today, it's no change, no need jerk reactions from our customers, but kind of a cautionary stance.\n\nAnd that's -- that makes sense given where we are. So we think our 1.5% to 2% load growth for 2025 is intact fully in the first quarter was evidence that we're right in line with that.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nWe also see the potential, Carly for some of our customers to increase production because the tariffs actually help their business, think about steel producers and those type of folks. So we're in contact with some of those customers as well.\n\nCarly Davenport\n\nThat's great. Very clear. Thanks so much for the time.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe currently have no further questions, so I'd like to hand back to Harry Sedaris for some closing remarks.\n\nHarry Sideris\n\nAll right. Thank you everyone, and thank you for your investment in Duke Energy. Our IR team is standing by if you have any further questions during the day, and I hope everybody has a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
    "cleaned_text": "Thank you, Abby, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the quarter, let me start by saying how excited I am to be with you today on my first call as CEO. Since we announced our leadership succession in January, I've had the opportunity to spend time with many stakeholders, including our customers, investors, regulators and Duke Energy teammates. These conversations centered around the same theme, the critical role Duke Energy plays in powering the lives of our communities and serving the incredible power demand facing the nation. We are projecting low growth at levels I've never seen in my 30-year career, which will drive more than a decade of record infrastructure build. We are ready to meet the moment with a renewed focus on speed and agility and supported by the same spirit of innovation that has been at the heart of this company for over a century. As I assumed the CEO role during this pivotal point for our company and industry, Duke Energy's mission remains unchanged. Delivering long-term value for shareholders and superior service to our customers and communities by building a smarter energy future. Moving to the quarterly results. Today, we announced first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 1.76, which marks a strong start to the year. These results were 0.32 above last year. driven top line growth across our electric and gas utilities. The constructive regulatory outcomes we've delivered over the last several years provide line of sight to earnings growth with minimized rate case exposure in 2025 and 2026.

Shahriar Pourreza Hey guys, good morning. Brian Savoy Good morning, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza Morning. Just I guess, first, it's -- obviously, it's been reaffirmed, but you're seeing, obviously, a fairly strong step-up in '27. You're signing more letters of agreements, '27 isn't that far off.

I'll start off and turn it over to Brian for any feedback he has on it as well. So we just updated our plan in February, as you know, 83 billion for the next five years, half of that going into the grid, half of it for a generation build.

And then just maybe a question for Brian. Just on credit metrics, I mean, obviously, the key thing is the visibility is improving. You guys are monetizing the tax credit you're getting storm cost recoveries. I guess when can we start seeing some more specificity around actual target ranges within the plan versus the 100 basis points, 200 basis guidance you guys have been out there for some time. Is there a point when you can start to disclose around actual ranges you guys decide to -- you can land that during the trajectory? Thanks. Brian Savoy I appreciate the question, Shar. And it's something that we've been discussing a lot internally as we've continued to improve the credit profile of Duke and growing the operating cash flow and clearing some of these items that are in front of us like storm recovery and storm securitization. So I think we're going to continue to evaluate it, but we'll see this within maybe our next cycle in February, we'll give a more defined targeted range on where we would be on the credit. Shahriar Pourreza Okay. That was actually my question. I appreciate that. Thanks, guys. Harry Sideris Thank you. Operator Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Jefferies. Julien Dumoulin-Smith Hey, good morning team. Thank you guys very much for the time. Hey, pleasure. Hey guys, just to follow up a little bit on what Shar have said. Picking at here. I mean 1 gigawatt of signed deals in April alone, quite a statement there. Just how are you thinking about the statement with respect to the cadence that you had contemplated? I mean, obviously, as you say, you've seen this accelerated load growth, but is it actually accelerating actively versus what you guys did contemplated initially. Maybe I'm not asking specifically about the CapEx, but just in terms of the cadence of adding a single gigawatt in a single month of data center deals specifically, I mean, are you seeing more than what you even talked about back in February? Or maybe another way to ask that is, where are you within that range of the 3 to 4 that you laid out just a handful of months ago as you see these data points coming in? Harry Sideris Yeah, Julien. Our pipeline continues to be robust and continues to grow. And we've really focused on accelerating getting projects through what we call our funnel to get them from the pipeline through these letter agreement stages to shore them up. So this 1 gigawatt that we just signed is working through our process. It's been contemplated in our plans. And we'll continue to work that large pipeline that we have to move more of these through our funnel to look at how we go to in the future. So we feel very comfortable and confident that we have a great pipeline, and we continue to find ways to work through that faster for our customers. Julien Dumoulin-Smith Got it. Understood. And then if I can pivot slight differently. I mean big announcement the other day with your friends at GV here. How do you think about the '19 turbine commitments, I mean, just against what you guys have in the plan. How do you think about that juxtaposing versus what's formal in the plan versus what's possible here again, I know that it's not a formal commitment on your side per se, but just curious how that fits and what that might suggest about future activities and future generation needs? Harry Sideris We were very pleased with the partnership with GE. We talked about meeting the moment at Duke and serving the tremendous load growth that we have ahead of us, and innovative agreements and framework agreements like this gives us the flexibility as we're moving projects through that funnel, that we're able to have the supply chain shored up in terms of turbines and other agreements that we have so that we could quickly serve these customers as they want to come on. So this is important to shore up and give us the flexibility as we move these projects into fruition that we're able to deliver them to the customer quickly because that's what they want. So these agreements are great. Julien Dumoulin-Smith Got it. Excellent. In '25 seems like you're trending well already. I mean, too early to talk about, shall we say, moving within the range, but how do you think about putting more latitude against shoring up where you are against the longer-term outlook, just even '26 here in derisking some of the future years? Brian Savoy Yeah. Julien, I think we look at our five-year plan and our 5 to 7 growth and feel very good about that growth outlook. And good start to '25 obviously helps every year in front of it. So we think that 2026 planning has been underway for many months now as we think about the years ahead, and we're well positioned to deliver on that growth range as we look at the plan. Julien Dumoulin-Smith Great, guys. Alright, thank you so much. Brian Savoy Thank you. Harry Sideris Thank you. Operator Durgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI Group. Durgesh Chopra Good morning team. Thank you for giving me time. Congrats Harry, once again. multiple speakers you guys have discussed the DEP and DEC merger in the past. Maybe just a little bit more color, what are the financial implications of that merger, when approved cost savings? I know there's going to be some operations streamlining. But just any color you can share there would be appreciated. Harry Sideris Yes, sir, yes. We're excited about the opportunity to merge our DEC and DEP utilities, something we've contemplated since the merger back in 2012. Stakeholders are very supportive of this. It does generate a lot of savings over time for our customers over 1 billion. So that will help with the affordability to our rates for our customers going forward. It really focuses on operational savings, fuel savings from running a combined system, managing our reserve margins as a whole instead of separately allowing us to put plants in the best location and optimize that. It's less regulatory proceedings, which are regulators like as well as us. So it continues to provide a lot of benefits for our customers. So we continue to work with our stakeholders on finalizing the details. Like I mentioned earlier, we plan to file later this summer with the North Carolina and South Carolina commissions as well as FERC and look to be running as one utility in January of 2027. Durgesh Chopra Got it. Okay. Sounds like a ton of room for making improvements on the customer front. Great. Just one quick follow-up on the data center, 1 gigawatt signing. Can you just size how many customers is that? Just trying to get a flavor for, are these one or two large customers or just the megawatts per customer, if you will? Thank you. Harry Sideris Yeah. The 1 gigawatt we talk about is actually two customers. Durgesh Chopra Okay. Thanks so much. Operator Carly Davenport, Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport Hey, good morning, thank you for taking my question. multiple speakers -- good morning, thank you for taking my question. maybe just to start, IRP has been pretty topical throughout earnings season here as we look at some of the potential legislation coming through reconciliations. Can you just provide your latest views on the outlook both for transferability and the future of the tax credits that support a lot of these renewables projects? And can you just remind us in terms of what is actually baked into the financial plan from a transferability perspective? Harry Sideris Yeah, I'll take that one, Carly. We appreciate the -- what Congress has ahead of them and how many priorities they'll be weighing as they work through the budget reconciliation process. We tend to look at this from the customers' perspective, and really our overarching objective is to maintain affordability for our customers, and that's what we've framed our advocacy around. The savings our customers receive from these energy credits fall right in line to what the President wants to do, which is delivering on this promise to reduce power bills across the country. As you know, each one of these dollars that we earn in energy tax credits goes back to our customers. The nuclear tax credits are most important to us. Our well-run, low-cost nuclear plants earn over 500 billion of tax credits that go directly to reducing our customers' bills. Nuclear has broad support in Washington. And we were pleased to see last week 26 representative sign a letter, stressing the importance of the nuclear tax credit and transferability to the President's objective of affordable and reliable energy. So we continue to work with folks in Washington to advocate to help our customers lower their bills, reduce credits, and we will continue to do that as they work through the process. Carly Davenport Great. I appreciate that. And then maybe just as we think about the macro, is there anything that you're seeing or hearing from, in particular, your industrial customer base in terms of activity levels potentially being impacted by a higher degree of economic and policy uncertainty at this point? Brian Savoy It's obviously the topic everyone is talking about, Carly, and we're in close communication with our large customers as we always are. And we've not seen any changes to their production schedules or expectations for '25. But I would say, there's somewhat of a cautionary stance, right? Because inaudible everybody is waiting for the finalization of where the tariff policies might land and their inputs reliance on the global supply chain, all factor into that equation. So I would say that today, it's no change, no need jerk reactions from our customers, but kind of a cautionary stance. And that's -- that makes sense given where we are. So we think our 1.5 to 2 load growth for 2025 is intact fully in the first quarter was evidence that we're right in line with that. Harry Sideris We also see the potential, Carly for some of our customers to increase production because the tariffs actually help their business, think about steel producers and those type of folks. So we're in contact with some of those customers as well. Carly Davenport That's great. Very clear. Thanks so much for the time. Harry Sideris Thank you. Operator We currently have no further questions, so I'd like to hand back to Harry Sedaris for some closing remarks. Harry Sideris All right. Thank you everyone, and thank you for your investment in Duke Energy. Our IR team is standing by if you have any further questions during the day, and I hope everybody has a great day.

      "And Brian, do you have anything to add?",

      "Just trying to get a flavor for, are these one or two large customers or just the megawatts per customer, if you will?",
      "Thank you.",
      "Harry Sideris Yeah.",
      "The 1 gigawatt we talk about is actually two customers.",
      "Durgesh Chopra Okay.",
      "Thanks so much.",
      "Operator Carly Davenport, Goldman Sachs.",
      "Carly Davenport Hey, good morning, thank you for taking my question.",
      "multiple speakers -- good morning, thank you for taking my question.",
      "maybe just to start, IRP has been pretty topical throughout earnings season here as we look at some of the potential legislation coming through reconciliations.",
      "Can you just provide your latest views on the outlook both for transferability and the future of the tax credits that support a lot of these renewables projects?",
      "And can you just remind us in terms of what is actually baked into the financial plan from a transferability perspective?",
      "Harry Sideris Yeah, I'll take that one, Carly.",
      "We appreciate the -- what Congress has ahead of them and how many priorities they'll be weighing as they work through the budget reconciliation process.",
      "We tend to look at this from the customers' perspective, and really our overarching objective is to maintain affordability for our customers, and that's what we've framed our advocacy around.",
      "The savings our customers receive from these energy credits fall right in line to what the President wants to do, which is delivering on this promise to reduce power bills across the country.",
      "As you know, each one of these dollars that we earn in energy tax credits goes back to our customers.",
      "The nuclear tax credits are most important to us.",
      "Our well-run, low-cost nuclear plants earn over 500 billion of tax credits that go directly to reducing our customers' bills.",
      "Nuclear has broad support in Washington.",
      "And we were pleased to see last week 26 representative sign a letter, stressing the importance of the nuclear tax credit and transferability to the President's objective of affordable and reliable energy.",
      "So we continue to work with folks in Washington to advocate to help our customers lower their bills, reduce credits, and we will continue to do that as they work through the process.",
      "Carly Davenport Great.",
      "I appreciate that.",
      "And then maybe just as we think about the macro, is there anything that you're seeing or hearing from, in particular, your industrial customer base in terms of activity levels potentially being impacted by a higher degree of economic and policy uncertainty at this point?",
      "Brian Savoy",
      "It's obviously the topic everyone is talking about, Carly, and we're in close communication with our large customers as we always are.",
      "And we've not seen any changes to their production schedules or expectations for '25.",
      "But I would say, there's somewhat of a cautionary stance, right?",
      "Because inaudible everybody is waiting for the finalization of where the tariff policies might land and their inputs reliance on the global supply chain, all factor into that equation.",
      "So I would say that today, it's no change, no need jerk reactions from our customers, but kind of a cautionary stance.",
      "And that's -- that makes sense given where we are.",
      "So we think our 1.5 to 2 load growth for 2025 is intact fully in the first quarter was evidence that we're right in line with that.",
      "Harry Sideris We also see the potential, Carly for some of our customers to increase production because the tariffs actually help their business, think about steel producers and those type of folks.",
      "So we're in contact with some of those customers as well.",
      "Carly Davenport",
      "That's great.",
      "Very clear.",
      "Thanks so much for the time.",
      "Harry Sideris Thank you.",
      "Operator We currently have no further questions, so I'd like to hand back to Harry Sedaris for some closing remarks.",
      "Harry Sideris All right.",
      "Thank you everyone, and thank you for your investment in Duke Energy.",
      "Our IR team is standing by if you have any further questions during the day, and I hope everybody has a great day.",
      "Operator This concludes today's call.",
      "Thank you very much for joining.",
      "You may now disconnect your lines."

    "text": "While oil majors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. are content to ride out the storm, especially if it means less regulation and easier permitting over the long term, the smaller independent producers who are the backbone of the US shale industry are starting to push back.\n\nExecutives from several private and independent oil companies have met in recent weeks with Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin and congressional representatives, according to company officials. The message they\u2019re promoting is Trump\u2019s trade war and repeated praise for falling oil prices risk pushing record US production into decline.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have $50 oil and \u2018Drill, Baby, Drill,\u2019\u201d said Andy Hendricks, the CEO of Patterson-UTI Energy Inc., which operates the second-largest fleet of US onshore drilling rigs. \u201cThose two things are incompatible.\u201d\n\nFalling oil prices help achieve a key pledge of Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 to lower inflation \u2014 and are generally good for the economy writ large and popular with voters. But now that the US is the world\u2019s top crude producer, that slide is straining Republican strongholds like Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota.\n\nThe US oil industry strongly supported Trump\u2019s campaign for a second term, but some executives are now feeling shortchanged. The president\u2019s trade policy has made buying and repairing equipment more expensive at the same time crude has tumbled more than 20% since his inauguration, further undermined by a surge in supply from OPEC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really being helped by what Trump is doing,\u201d the 63-year-old said. \u201cHe\u2019s a hell of a lot smarter than I am, but I\u2019m not sure that he wakes up every morning saying, \u2018God, I hope oil goes back to $70,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cLike I do.\u201d\n\nTariffs and uncertainty over equipment deliveries mean what was once routine for Hardin\u2019s King Well Service Inc. is now a source of anxiety. It\u2019s made all the worse by plunging crude prices, triggered in part by the trade disputes, that threaten to slow drilling of new wells.\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Terrel Hardin was at a diner along Route 66 in western Oklahoma when his phone rang with bad news: The engine on one of his oil rigs had broken. In times past it would be a straightforward $6,000 fix, but President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has upended supply chains, and he wasn\u2019t sure the part would even be available.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cThe industry\u2019s message to Congress is \u2018Take back your authority,\u2019\u201d said Steven Pruett, the chief executive officer of Midland, Texas-based Elevation Resources LLC, who met with Cruz last month. He\u2019s concerned that major economic policy is being set by executive fiat. \u201cThat\u2019s no way to run a country, and it\u2019s impossible for corporate leaders to run their businesses.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to an email and phone call seeking comment. Representatives for the EPA and Energy Department said the agencies are focused on slashing regulations to drive down costs for consumers and lower expenses for oil companies, which will ultimately make them more profitable.\n\nTrump is scheduled to visit the Middle East soon, meeting leaders of OPEC countries who this month agreed to raise production levels, sending West Texas Intermediate as low as $55 a barrel, well under what many US shale fields need to break even. Several of the executives interviewed said they want Trump to provide tariff carve-outs for oil field equipment and set a floor under oil prices by persuading OPEC leaders to restrain production, like he did after the price collapse in early 2020, or by refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\nKirk Edwards, a former chairman of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, voted for Trump last year and regularly supports Republican causes. There\u2019s a framed picture on the wall of his office in Odessa, Texas, of himself and the president standing side-by-side with their thumbs up at a fundraiser last year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more American than the oil and gas industry,\u201d said Edwards, who runs a small privately-held oil producer. \u201cSo why are we being picked on as a scapegoat in this whole tariff plan?\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t hard to see why he\u2019s so concerned. With crude prices below the average break-even price for most new US onshore wells, oil companies aren\u2019t positioned to meet the president\u2019s call to unleash energy dominance, said Clayton Seigle, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cTheir investors don\u2019t care about energy dominance,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want energy dividends.\u201d\n\nTop Producer\n\nBut of course for every oil executive or roughneck lamenting the drop in oil prices, many more Americans appreciate lower gasoline prices and the relief that provides for household budgets.\n\nThe Trump administration has already taken steps that could lower costs for offshore oil operations, including regulatory changes expected to allow companies to simultaneously pull crude from multiple Gulf of Mexico reservoirs, boosting output and potentially unlocking stranded reserves. The Interior Department has announced plans that could lower costs for offshore producers by revising requirements forcing them to set aside financial assurance guarantees to cover the cost of cleaning up old wells and infrastructure. The EPA, meanwhile, is pursuing efforts that could lower cost for onshore operators, too.\n\nTrump inherited a US oil industry at the peak of its powers, producing a near-record 13.5 million barrels a day. It provided jobs and a level of energy independence the US hadn\u2019t seen since before the OPEC oil embargos of the 1970s. Trump\u2019s pledges to support America\u2019s \u201cliquid gold\u201d energized supporters in the oil field who felt under attack by President Joe Biden\u2019s environmental policies.\n\nBut four months after Trump\u2019s inauguration, producers are cutting crews, mothballing rigs and reining in spending as they grapple with rising costs and lower revenue because of the oil price plunge.\n\n\u201cAs a result of these activity cuts, it is likely that US onshore oil production has peaked and will begin to decline this quarter,\u201d Travis Stice, the CEO of Diamondback Energy Inc., the biggest independent producer in the Permian Basin of western Texas and eastern New Mexico, said in a letter to shareholders. \u201cWe are at a tipping point.\u201d\n\nThe main road through the heart of Texas oil country includes a 15-mile stretch of Interstate 20 between Midland and Odessa that might be the biggest concentration of steel for sale in America. The area is like an open-air shopping mall providing everything needed to pump crude oil. Drilling rigs and powerful generators for fracking fleets operated by the world\u2019s biggest oil field service companies sit alongside family-owned retailers selling pipes, pumps, hard hats and flame retardant overalls.\n\nMuch of the equipment is imported from China, Korea, Brazil and Mexico, meaning it\u2019s subject to tariffs. Prices for tubular goods used in the industry, which includes pipes, are forecast to jump by 40% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to Wood Mackenzie, an industry consultant.\n\nTie Specialties, a store along that section of highway, is the \u201cHome Depot of the oil field,\u201d according to its owner, Mark Waters. He backs Trump\u2019s tariffs and push for low energy prices because he thinks they will be good for the country in the long-term. That said, he accepts he will make less money in the short term. Sales were down about 15% in April from a year earlier.\n\n\u201cI smile when these guys are gung-ho on the Republican Party,\u201d Waters said. \u201cWe make our money during Democratic administrations. I killed it during Clinton, Obama, Biden.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t a popular message in West Texas.\n\n\u201cI said that at the country club and I thought somebody was going to kill me with a butter knife,\u201d Waters joked.\n\nWright, Trump\u2019s energy secretary, was a familiar face in Midland as CEO of the fracking company Liberty Energy Inc. before his appointment. He knows only too well the price being paid by his former friends in the oil business: Shares of Liberty are down almost 50% since Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\nWright maintains the Trump administration doesn\u2019t set oil prices and is focused on removing \u201cartificial barriers\u201d to production such as excessive regulations and climate rules.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make it easier to produce energy in the United States,\u201d he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on April 25.\n\nBut he appeared to acknowledge the pain in the oil patch.\n\n\u201cFifty dollars, in today\u2019s world, I think is not sustainable for producers in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cA good place is where you have healthy consumers, you have healthy producers.\u201d\n\nIndependent US oil explorers have announced over the past several weeks a combined $1.8 billion in spending cuts, with most of that shrinking activity coming in the Permian Basin, the world\u2019s biggest shale patch. For now, many of the companies, including Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Devon Energy Corp., say that greater efficiencies in the field will mean little or no impact to production this year.\n\nBut the outlook a little bit down the line is less rosy. A 10% cut to US capital expenditure would mean a 400,000 barrel-a-day drop in production, according to S&P Global. And nearly everyone agrees that if oil prices continue dropping to the low $50 range, more reductions would have to come.\n\nAn electronic sign across the road from the Petroleum Club in Midland, Texas, sums up the mood. On a recent afternoon, its display cycled through the falling number of rigs deployed across the Permian Basin and the plunging price of crude.\n\nIt also displayed a quote often attributed to Winston Churchill: \u201cHowever beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Jennifer A. Dlouhy and Ari Natter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

Story Continues The industry s message to Congress is Take back your authority, said Steven Pruett, the chief executive officer of Midland, Texas-based Elevation Resources LLC, who met with Cruz last month. He s concerned that major economic policy is being set by executive fiat. That s no way to run a country, and it s impossible for corporate leaders to run their businesses. Cruz s office didn t respond to an email and phone call seeking comment. Representatives for the EPA and Energy Department said the agencies are focused on slashing regulations to drive down costs for consumers and lower expenses for oil companies, which will ultimately make them more profitable. Trump is scheduled to visit the Middle East soon, meeting leaders of OPEC countries who this month agreed to raise production levels, sending West Texas Intermediate as low as 55 a barrel, well under what many US shale fields need to break even. Several of the executives interviewed said they want Trump to provide tariff carve-outs for oil field equipment and set a floor under oil prices by persuading OPEC leaders to restrain production, like he did after the price collapse in early 2020, or by refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Kirk Edwards, a former chairman of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, voted for Trump last year and regularly supports Republican causes. There s a framed picture on the wall of his office in Odessa, Texas, of himself and the president standing side-by-side with their thumbs up at a fundraiser last year. There s nothing more American than the oil and gas industry, said Edwards, who runs a small privately-held oil producer. So why are we being picked on as a scapegoat in this whole tariff plan? It isn t hard to see why he s so concerned. With crude prices below the average break-even price for most new US onshore wells, oil companies aren t positioned to meet the president s call to unleash energy dominance, said Clayton Seigle, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Their investors don t care about energy dominance, he said. They want energy dividends. Top Producer But of course for every oil executive or roughneck lamenting the drop in oil prices, many more Americans appreciate lower gasoline prices and the relief that provides for household budgets. The Trump administration has already taken steps that could lower costs for offshore oil operations, including regulatory changes expected to allow companies to simultaneously pull crude from multiple Gulf of Mexico reservoirs, boosting output and potentially unlocking stranded reserves. The Interior Department has announced plans that could lower costs for offshore producers by revising requirements forcing them to set aside financial assurance guarantees to cover the cost of cleaning up old wells and infrastructure. The EPA, meanwhile, is pursuing efforts that could lower cost for onshore operators, too. Trump inherited a US oil industry at the peak of its powers, producing a near-record 13.5 million barrels a day. It provided jobs and a level of energy independence the US hadn t seen since before the OPEC oil embargos of the 1970s. Trump s pledges to support America s liquid gold energized supporters in the oil field who felt under attack by President Joe Biden s environmental policies. But four months after Trump s inauguration, producers are cutting crews, mothballing rigs and reining in spending as they grapple with rising costs and lower revenue because of the oil price plunge. As a result of these activity cuts, it is likely that US onshore oil production has peaked and will begin to decline this quarter, Travis Stice, the CEO of Diamondback Energy Inc., the biggest independent producer in the Permian Basin of western Texas and eastern New Mexico, said in a letter to shareholders. We are at a tipping point. The main road through the heart of Texas oil country includes a 15-mile stretch of Interstate 20 between Midland and Odessa that might be the biggest concentration of steel for sale in America. The area is like an open-air shopping mall providing everything needed to pump crude oil. Drilling rigs and powerful generators for fracking fleets operated by the world s biggest oil field service companies sit alongside family-owned retailers selling pipes, pumps, hard hats and flame retardant overalls. Much of the equipment is imported from China, Korea, Brazil and Mexico, meaning it s subject to tariffs. Prices for tubular goods used in the industry, which includes pipes, are forecast to jump by 40 year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to Wood Mackenzie, an industry consultant. Tie Specialties, a store along that section of highway, is the Home Depot of the oil field, according to its owner, Mark Waters. He backs Trump s tariffs and push for low energy prices because he thinks they will be good for the country in the long-term. That said, he accepts he will make less money in the short term. Sales were down about 15 in April from a year earlier. I smile when these guys are gung-ho on the Republican Party, Waters said. We make our money during Democratic administrations. I killed it during Clinton, Obama, Biden. It isn t a popular message in West Texas. I said that at the country club and I thought somebody was going to kill me with a butter knife, Waters joked. Wright, Trump s energy secretary, was a familiar face in Midland as CEO of the fracking company Liberty Energy Inc. before his appointment. He knows only too well the price being paid by his former friends in the oil business: Shares of Liberty are down almost 50 since Trump s inauguration on Jan. 20. Wright maintains the Trump administration doesn t set oil prices and is focused on removing artificial barriers to production such as excessive regulations and climate rules. Our goal is to make it easier to produce energy in the United States, he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on April 25. But he appeared to acknowledge the pain in the oil patch. Fifty dollars, in today s world, I think is not sustainable for producers in this country, he said. A good place is where you have healthy consumers, you have healthy producers. Independent US oil explorers have announced over the past several weeks a combined 1.8 billion in spending cuts, with most of that shrinking activity coming in the Permian Basin, the world s biggest shale patch. For now, many of the companies, including Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Devon Energy Corp., say that greater efficiencies in the field will mean little or no impact to production this year. But the outlook a little bit down the line is less rosy. A 10 cut to US capital expenditure would mean a 400,000 barrel-a-day drop in production, according to S P Global. And nearly everyone agrees that if oil prices continue dropping to the low 50 range, more reductions would have to come. An electronic sign across the road from the Petroleum Club in Midland, Texas, sums up the mood. On a recent afternoon, its display cycled through the falling number of rigs deployed across the Permian Basin and the plunging price of crude. It also displayed a quote often attributed to Winston Churchill: However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results. --With assistance from Jennifer A. Dlouhy and Ari Natter.

    "baseline_summary": "The US oil industry strongly supported Trump s campaign for a second term, but some executives are now feeling shortchanged. The president s trade policy has made buying and repairing equipment more expensive at the same time crude has tumbled more than 20 since his inauguration.",
    "finetuned_summary": "Expert: Trump's trade war and praise for falling oil prices risk pushing record US production into decline. While oil majors like Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron are content to ride out the storm, especially if it means less regulation and easier permitting over the long term, the smaller independent producers who are the backbone of the US shale industry are starting to push back."

By the same token, K\u00e4llenius said the company will not restore the financial outlook it withdrew several weeks ago amid the uncertainty.\n\n\"What we have decided to do in this current environment is to send a signal of stability towards our customers, but also our business partners,\" K\u00e4llenius said. \"And we will see how things develop. We are in the position that we don't have to make hasty decisions on things like that [price increases], and we won't. So I don't want to pull out the crystal ball now and say what's the world going to look like six months from now, but our priority for the US market will be long-term growth, taking care of our great customer base.\"\n\nThe Trump administration tossed a small bone to global automakers several weeks ago, moving to relax some of the 25% tariffs slapped on autos and auto parts.\n\nThe new executive order allows car companies to be reimbursed for up to 3.75% of the value of US-assembled vehicles to help offset the cost of tariffs in year one.

    "finetuned_summary": "Investors are likely to be forced to chase the stock rally sparked by the US-China trade truce after mostly missing out on last month s rebound, Bank of America Corp. strategists said. A survey by the bank conducted before the trade talks in Geneva showed fund managers were a net 38 underweight on US stocks, the most in two years. Exposure to the dollar was the lowest since 2006, with about 40 of respondents looking to increase hedges against declines in the US currency. Optimism over the economic outlook has significantly improved following the agreement between Washington and Beijing to temporarily cut tariffs on each other s products. But with investor exposure to stocks so low, market participants have warned a sustained equity rally would leave bearish positions sitting on"

    "summary": "Meta Platforms and PayPal stocks are affordably priced, especially among stocks in the tech sector.  AI investments have paid off for Meta, helping the stock outperform in recent years.  PayPal's stock has been in a slump, but new company leadership and expansion into digital advertising have the potential to stimulate growth.",
    "text": "The main cause for concern with Meta Platforms is an overreliance on advertising, as it makes up about 98% of the company's total revenue. In an economic downturn in which companies slash their marketing budgets, Meta Platforms could struggle. And a downturn might be on the way -- J.P. Morgan analysts recently put the odds of a recession in the next year at 60%.\n\nSpeaking of AI, that's looking much more promising for Meta. It's using AI-powered content recommendations to increase user engagement on its social platforms, and AI-enabled ad tools are helping advertisers get a better return on their spending, which is encouraging additional spending. In Meta's first-quarter results, it reported a 5% year-over-year increase in ad impressions and a 10% increase in the average price per ad. In addition, total revenue for the quarter increased by 16% and adjusted earnings per share jumped by 37%, both beating expectations.\n\nNot every swing has been a home run, at least so far. Meta Platforms' Reality Labs, which focuses on VR, AR, and the metaverse, has reported losses exceeding $60 billion over the past five years related to its development efforts. It's still too early to write this division off -- Ray-Ban Meta glasses surpassed 1 million in sales last year and now have AI features -- but the results to this point haven't been great.\n\nThe best tech companies are adaptive and forward-thinking -- attributes that Meta Platforms has in spades. Since starting out in social media, it has expanded into virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), the metaverse, and artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nHere's why each of these tech stocks can make for a good long-term investment right now.\n\nTwo notable exceptions are Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL). The former is close to the S&P 500 average when measuring its forward price-to-earnings ratio. The latter is quite a bit cheaper than the average.\n\nQuality tech stocks trading at reasonable valuations aren't easy to find lately. The sector has plenty of highly successful stocks, but many of them range from expensive to really expensive when comparing valuations.\n\nPayPal's stock has been in a slump, but new company leadership and expansion into digital advertising have the potential to stimulate growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBut Meta is a profitable company with $70.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of March 31. It's financially strong enough to ride out a downturn. During the last three years, Meta's stock price has grown 238%, nearly five times as much as the S&P 500. Although it likely won't keep up that pace of growth over the next decade, its AI investments and massive user base should help it continue to outperform the market.\n\n2. PayPal\n\nPayPal stock hasn't performed nearly as well as Meta recently. It's down 4.3% over the last three years, and the company faces increasing competition from other digital payment options, including Apple Pay, Alphabet's Google Pay, and Zelle.\n\nHowever, PayPal is also under new leadership, with CEO Alex Chriss taking over in September 2023. Before that, Chriss managed the Small Business and Self-Employed Group at Intuit. He helped drive strong growth in customers and revenue there, and he's getting praise for his performance with PayPal. He has overhauled the leadership team and established new e-commerce partnerships, including an online checkout deal with Amazon.\n\nThose aren't the only recent changes at PayPal. Earlier this year, PayPal announced a full-service merchant platform, PayPal Open, that unifies all its offerings under a single platform. It's also entering the digital advertising space with PayPal Ads.\n\nConsidering PayPal has 400 million users and Venmo has more than 92 million, advertising is a massive untapped revenue opportunity. PayPal also still has a reliable core business, with over $1.5 trillion in annual payment volume. And it has been building positive momentum. The first quarter of 2025 was the fifth in a row of profitable growth, with operating income increasing by 31%.\n\nPayPal has a good balance sheet, including $15.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of March 31 compared to $12.6 billion in debt. At the current price, and with ads on the horizon, this is a deep value stock that could pay off handsomely for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $614,911!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $714,958!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 907% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 163% for the S&P 500.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) stands against other stock picks with huge upside potential.\n\nDavid Abrams founded Abrams Capital Management in 1999. Before forming the Boston-based investment firm, Abrams worked at Seth Klarman\u2019s Baupost Group for 10 years. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a BA degree in History, where he also served on the Board of Advisors of the College of Arts and Sciences. Abrams didn\u2019t have a finance background when he got his first job in New York in the early 1980s. He learned all about investing under Seth Klarman before setting out independently after a decade. He is a value investor, and in the ~12 years of his fund, he has achieved an annualized return of around 20%. His firm is like a one-man shop, which employs a small staff. Abrams Capital has 9 clients and discretionary assets under management (AUM) of $10.05 billion, as reported in the firm\u2019s Form ADV dated 13 January 2025. The last reported 13F filing for Q4 2024 included $6.22 billion in managed 13F securities and a top 10 holdings concentration of 98.7%.\n\nAbrams is known for maintaining a low public profile, but in a conversation on Columbia Business School\u2019s \u2018Value Investing with Legends\u2019 Podcast series, he discussed the surface of his foundational principles when it comes to his investment philosophy. He starts by looking at the risks first and foremost, without any consideration of prospective gains. This is a reminder that the future remains unpredictable, which Abrams puts in the following words:\n\n\u201cWhen you look back, there\u2019s one path that happened, but that doesn\u2019t mean that going forward there\u2019s only one path. In the future, there\u2019s multiple paths.\u201d\n\nAbrams\u2019 portfolio reflects a balanced approach with exposure to growth sectors like Industrials and Consumer Cyclical, while also maintaining moderate allocations in established industries such as Communication Services. He also believes that declining industries can present stability because they attract limited new entrants. This also implies that high-growth sectors are, on the contrary, characterized by intense competition, which necessitates a more detailed analysis of potential competitive threats. Here\u2019s what Abrams had to say about this:\n\n\u201cIf you have a shrinking industry and it\u2019s dying, it\u2019s like, people are not dying to get into that.\u201d\n\nAbrams serves as a director of several private companies. He is currently on the board of MITMCO, which manages the MIT endowment. Previously, he was a trustee of Berklee College of Music for 15 years, where he chaired the investment committee. He was also the trustee of Milton Academy.",

Its non-GAAP profit of $2.22 per share was 4% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\n\nIs now the time to buy MRK? Find out in our full research report (it\u2019s free).\n\nMerck (MRK) Q1 CY2025 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $15.53 billion vs analyst estimates of $15.29 billion (1.6% year-on-year decline, 1.6% beat)\n\nAdjusted EPS: $2.22 vs analyst estimates of $2.14 (4% beat)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA: $7.72 billion vs analyst estimates of $6.88 billion (49.7% margin, 12.2% beat)\n\nThe company reconfirmed its revenue guidance for the full year of $64.85 billion at the midpoint\n\nOperating Margin: 37.8%, up from 35.7% in the same quarter last year\n\nFree Cash Flow Margin: 7.5%, down from 14.1% in the same quarter last year\n\nConstant Currency Revenue rose 1% year on year (12% in the same quarter last year)\n\nMarket Capitalization: $190.8 billion\n\nStockStory\u2019s Take\n\nMerck\u2019s first quarter performance was shaped by steady demand in its oncology and animal health businesses and the growing contribution from new product launches such as WinRevair and Cafaxib. Management cited a pronounced decline in Gardasil sales in China, which offset growth in other segments, while ongoing investments in U.S. manufacturing and supply chain flexibility emerged as key themes.

    "finetuned_summary": "Baron Funds, an investment management company, released its Baron Technology Fund first quarter 2025 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. Market trends are often driven by sentiment in addition to fundamental elements, and the first quarter of 2025 was a clear example of this. January saw a strong performance for the Fund, driven by investor excitement around long-term growth trends in AI. Optimism was fueled by expectations of the new Trump administration's policies to accelerate economic growth. However, by mid-February, fears of tariffs, a potential trade war, and geopolitical shifts reversed market gains, leading to significant volatility."

It aimed to shift that spending toward rapidly growing its clean energy businesses.\n\nHowever, a recovery in oil prices and years of underperformance led the oil giant to shift gears on its strategy again earlier this year. It's slashing spending on renewables from a plan to invest $5 billion annually to a $1.5 billion to $2 billion yearly level.\n\nMeanwhile, it's boosting its oil and gas capital investment plan to $10 billion per year. As a result, BP will grow its renewable business much more slowly while increasing its overall oil and gas output to an average of 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day by 2030, up from less than 2.4 million BOE last year.\n\nBP's abrupt strategy shifts have it searching for an identity. It stands in stark contrast to U.S. oil giants Exxon and Chevron, which have well-defined multiyear strategies for growing shareholder value. For example, Exxon plans to invest $140 billion in developing its advantaged assets (lower cost and higher margin) while stripping out billions of structural costs. This plan has the oil giant on track to add an incremental $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in free cash flow by 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, Chevron is also investing heavily in growing its advantaged assets, which will drive industry-leading free-cash-flow growth of as much as $10 billion by 2026. Both oil companies are also investing strategically to grow their lower-carbon energy platforms, focusing on investments that can earn attractive returns, like carbon capture and storage, biofuels, and hydrogen.",

    "text": "The company\u2019s planned one-month production halt later this year for retooling its Illinois facility to prepare for the R2 model launch will temporarily impact output, but it is necessary for long-term growth.\n\nDespite this progress, the company still faces supply chain vulnerabilities (especially for battery materials and semiconductors), substantial cash burn (with negative free cash flow exceeding $5 billion over the past year ), competition from both established automakers and other EV startups, and risks related to scaling production and launching new models.\n\nStrategic partnerships are also important in Rivian\u2019s growth. Volkswagen\u2019s investment is a significant milestone, and Rivian continues to benefit from a $6.6 billion U.S. Department of Energy loan to support its manufacturing expansion plans.\n\nRivian reported a $22,600 year-over-year cost reduction per vehicle in Q1 2025, a significant improvement in manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies. Meanwhile, revenue from software and services surged 258% to $318 million. The combination of these is resulting in a growing high-margin business segment.\n\nI am bullish on the stock over the long term, but caution that this one will require significant patience and intestinal fortitude, and is not for those who aren\u2019t up for a long car trip along a bumpy (but scenic) highway.\n\nDespite these positive developments, Rivian\u2019s stock responded with a dip in trading the following day, only to reclaim that lost ground the day after, leaving the stock essentially flat. The market\u2019s tepid reaction reflects concerns about the company\u2019s adjusted guidance and broader industry challenges.\n\nPerhaps most encouraging was Rivian\u2019s second consecutive quarter of gross profit, reaching $206 million. This achievement triggered a major milestone: a $1 billion investment from Volkswagen (VWAGY) expected to close by June 30. With $8.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, Rivian appears well-positioned to weather near-term market instability.\n\nEV maker Rivian Automotive (RIVN) delivered surprisingly strong Q1 2025 results last week, and yet, market participants chose to focus on management\u2019s forward guidance, which has put the stock into rangebound mode. The company reported a significant revenue boost while its loss per share narrowed to $0.41, which was much better than the anticipated $0.76 loss and marks substantial progress toward profitability.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTariffs Cast a Shadow on Delivery Targets\n\nDespite the solid Q1 results, management let the air out of the tires with a significant revision to delivery projections, lowering its 2025 target to 40,000-46,000 vehicles from its previous guidance of 46,000-51,000. The reduction was driven primarily by the anticipated impacts of new tariffs.\n\nRivian Automotive Vehicles Delivered\n\nU.S. tariffs on imported auto parts, particularly batteries and semiconductors from Asia, can create a ripple effect throughout Rivian\u2019s operations and increase production costs by several thousand dollars per vehicle. The Wall Street Journal has reported EV sales grinding to a halt in April, as this issue bites other players in the EV market.\n\nIn response to these challenges, Rivian has raised its capital expenditure forecast to $1.8-1.9 billion, up from $1.6-1.8 billion, to reflect the higher component costs and investments needed to adapt supply chains and manufacturing processes to the changing trade landscape.\n\nRIVN\u2019s Small But Growing Market Position\n\nRivian currently holds approximately 2.9% of the U.S. electric vehicle market, making it a significant but minor player compared to Tesla\u2019s dominant 50% share. Globally, Rivian\u2019s footprint is even smaller at roughly 0.23% of the EV market.\n\nThe company delivered about 8,640 vehicles in Q1 and aims for 40,000-46,000 in 2025, compared to Tesla\u2019s approximately 2 million annual deliveries. This scale difference underscores Rivian\u2019s position as a relative startup in the early stages of growth and suggests significant expansion potential.\n\nRivian trades at approximately 2.5x sales, a relative premium for a company that\u2019s not yet profitable, yet substantially lower than Tesla\u2019s 9.5x sales multiple.\n\nThe EV market is projected to reach 26% of U.S. new vehicle sales by 2030, and Rivian has opportunities to grow with the market while capturing share from traditional automakers. It is a rising tide that could lift all boats. Still, with Tesla\u2019s status as a mature market leader, Rivian looks to have the scrappy up-and-comer\u2019s advantage of potentially capitalizing on expanding market share within the growing market.\n\nPerformance Comparison between Rivian and Tesla stocks\n\nPerformance Comparison between Rivian and Tesla stocks\n\nIs RIVN a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\n\nThe broad consensus of the 25 analysts covering the stock on Wall Street is neutral. RIVN stock has a consensus rating of Hold based on seven Buy, 14 Hold, and four Sell ratings over the past three months. Its average price target of $13.80 implies approximately 3% downside potential over the next twelve months.\n\nAnalysts following the company remain divided but generally optimistic on Rivian\u2019s prospects. Canaccord Genuity maintains a Buy rating with a $23 price target, citing Rivian\u2019s potential to establish itself as a leading EV platform in Western markets, particularly as some competitors scale back their electric vehicle commitments.\n\nMeanwhile, Wedbush reiterated its Outperform rating while lowering its price target from $20 to $18, noting Rivian\u2019s strong financial performance while recognizing the challenges of the current economic environment.\n\nYet a more cautious view comes from UBS, which raised its target slightly to $13 but maintained a Neutral stance. UBS analysts suggest there\u2019s an \u201cair pocket\u201d for the stock until the company\u2019s AI day in the fall and as it gets closer to the R2 launch in early 2026.\n\nPatient Capital Required to Unlock RIVN\u2019s Potential\n\nRivian is an intriguing investment opportunity for hardy contrarian investors willing to swim in murkier waters. The company has shown impressive progress on profitability metrics, though it still faces significant headwinds from tariffs, competition, and market dynamics.\n\nNear-term catalysts include continued cost improvements, the official closing of the Volkswagen partnership, and updates on R2 development. However, meaningful stock appreciation may require patience until after the R2 launch in 2026.\n\nI am bullish on Rivian, but I will closely monitor quarterly delivery numbers, gross margin progression, and cash burn rates to gauge the company\u2019s trajectory toward sustainable growth and profitability.\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

With 8.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, Rivian appears well-positioned to weather near-term market instability. EV maker Rivian Automotive RIVN delivered surprisingly strong Q1 2025 results last week, and yet, market participants chose to focus on management s forward guidance, which has put the stock into rangebound mode. The company reported a significant revenue boost while its loss per share narrowed to 0.41, which was much better than the anticipated 0.76 loss and marks substantial progress toward profitability. Story Continues Tariffs Cast a Shadow on Delivery Targets Despite the solid Q1 results, management let the air out of the tires with a significant revision to delivery projections, lowering its 2025 target to 40,000-46,000 vehicles from its previous guidance of 46,000-51,000. The reduction was driven primarily by the anticipated impacts of new tariffs. Rivian Automotive Vehicles Delivered U.S. tariffs on imported auto parts, particularly batteries and semiconductors from Asia, can create a ripple effect throughout Rivian s operations and increase production costs by several thousand dollars per vehicle. The Wall Street Journal has reported EV sales grinding to a halt in April, as this issue bites other players in the EV market. In response to these challenges, Rivian has raised its capital expenditure forecast to 1.8-1.9 billion, up from 1.6-1.8 billion, to reflect the higher component costs and investments needed to adapt supply chains and manufacturing processes to the changing trade landscape. RIVN s Small But Growing Market Position Rivian currently holds approximately 2.9 of the U.S. electric vehicle market, making it a significant but minor player compared to Tesla s dominant 50 share. Globally, Rivian s footprint is even smaller at roughly 0.23 of the EV market. The company delivered about 8,640 vehicles in Q1 and aims for 40,000-46,000 in 2025, compared to Tesla s approximately 2 million annual deliveries. This scale difference underscores Rivian s position as a relative startup in the early stages of growth and suggests significant expansion potential. Rivian trades at approximately 2.5x sales, a relative premium for a company that s not yet profitable, yet substantially lower than Tesla s 9.5x sales multiple. The EV market is projected to reach 26 of U.S. new vehicle sales by 2030, and Rivian has opportunities to grow with the market while capturing share from traditional automakers. It is a rising tide that could lift all boats. Still, with Tesla s status as a mature market leader, Rivian looks to have the scrappy up-and-comer s advantage of potentially capitalizing on expanding market share within the growing market. Performance Comparison between Rivian and Tesla stocks Performance Comparison between Rivian and Tesla stocks Is RIVN a Buy, Hold, or Sell? The broad consensus of the 25 analysts covering the stock on Wall Street is neutral. RIVN stock has a consensus rating of Hold based on seven Buy, 14 Hold, and four Sell ratings over the past three months. Its average price target of 13.80 implies approximately 3 downside potential over the next twelve months. Analysts following the company remain divided but generally optimistic on Rivian s prospects. Canaccord Genuity maintains a Buy rating with a 23 price target, citing Rivian s potential to establish itself as a leading EV platform in Western markets, particularly as some competitors scale back their electric vehicle commitments. Meanwhile, Wedbush reiterated its Outperform rating while lowering its price target from 20 to 18, noting Rivian s strong financial performance while recognizing the challenges of the current economic environment. Yet a more cautious view comes from UBS, which raised its target slightly to 13 but maintained a Neutral stance. UBS analysts suggest there s an air pocket for the stock until the company s AI day in the fall and as it gets closer to the R2 launch in early 2026. Patient Capital Required to Unlock RIVN s Potential Rivian is an intriguing investment opportunity for hardy contrarian investors willing to swim in murkier waters. The company has shown impressive progress on profitability metrics, though it still faces significant headwinds from tariffs, competition, and market dynamics. Near-term catalysts include continued cost improvements, the official closing of the Volkswagen partnership, and updates on R2 development. However, meaningful stock appreciation may require patience until after the R2 launch in 2026. I am bullish on Rivian, but I will closely monitor quarterly delivery numbers, gross margin progression, and cash burn rates to gauge the company s trajectory toward sustainable growth and profitability.

    "finetuned_summary": "Rivian Automotive (RIVN) delivered surprisingly strong Q1 2025 results last week, and yet, market participants chose to focus on management s forward guidance, which has put the stock into rangebound mode. The market s tepid reaction reflects concerns about the company s adjusted guidance and broader industry challenges. RIVN currently holds approximately 2.9 of the U.S. electric vehicle market, making it a significant but minor player compared to Tesla (TSLA)"

(NASDAQ:ADBE) stands against other billionaire quants\u2019 two sigma\u2019s stock picks with huge upside potential.\n\nTwo Sigma Advisors is one of the leading players in the quantitative hedge fund space, according to Archive Market Research\u2019s analysis. The quant fund operates as an investment management company and was founded in 2001 by David Siegel, a computer scientist, and John Overdeck, a mathematician. The fund manages $60 billion worth of assets as of April 2025.\n\nQuant funds and their multi-strategy counterparts often do well in the market. A Reuters analysis found that many quant hedge funds posted double-digit growth in 2024. This growth happened despite \u201cnegative drivers\u201d in sectors like energy, metals, and European equities. Two Sigma, alongside quant funds like D.E. Shaw and Citadel, also managed solid performance last year.\n\nThe hedge fund\u2019s Spectrum Fund returned 10.9% and 14.3% for the Absolute Return Enhanced Fund. But one might argue that for a hedge fund that relies on complex algorithms to make investment decisions, the asset manager should have beat the market. For context, the S&P 500 finished 2024 with a total gain of 25.0%.\n\nREAD ALSO: Billionaire Ray Dalio\u2019s Bridgewater\u2019s 10 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential and Billionaire Mario Gabelli\u2019s 10 Large-Cap Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential.\n\nIn August last year, the billionaire founders of the hedge fund exited from active management because they couldn\u2019t resolve tension between them.\n\n\u201cOver the past year and a half, we and our senior management team have dedicated significant effort to securing the long-term success and stability of Two Sigma. Throughout this process, our own roles have been a central consideration. Today, we are confident that stepping back from our day-to-day management roles is the right decision at this time,\u201d the co-founders said in a letter to investors.\n\nBut recent reports indicate that Overdeck is returning to active management. \u201cJohn has determined now is the right time for him to return to this role in order to progress certain priorities and decisions he believes are important to the future of Two Sigma,\u201d Two Sigma said in a letter. Siegel chose to remain outside of the fund\u2019s top ranks but had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Scott Hoffman, one of the Co-CEOs who took over last year.\n\nIt is good news that Two Sigma won\u2019t be held back by feuding management because they need it to navigate a challenging market. According to a Reuters analysis, the risk of recession is alarming, even though it may not be as clear-cut. The report quoted Zurich Insurance Group\u2019s chief market strategist, Guy Miller, who said that the risk of a US recession is quite plausible. \u201cRecession risks have risen markedly even if there are some deals struck on tariffs.

The company has turned Kirkland into an $86 billion retail powerhouse that offers an incredibly diverse product line that ranges from dress shirts to high-end liquor. The Wall Street Journal detailed how Costco turned what seemed like a big gamble into a master stroke.\n\nThe business model for most retail grocery outlets' house brands has typically revolved around offering a lower-priced option than major brands, but with a few notable trade-offs. For example, generic cola at your typical grocery store is cheaper than Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), but it would probably not win a blind taste test against the major brand. Kirkland has defied that convention, and its products are on par with many major brands in terms of quality.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThere have long been rumors that Kirkland cuts private deals with major brands to supply its products, and many cocktail enthusiasts believe that Kirkland's French Vodka is Grey Goose in disguise. The Journal said that Kirkland now accounts for almost a third of Costco's total sales, but says Costco's original decision to create the brand 30 years ago carried a lot of risk.\n\nThat's because in the early 1990s, most of the world's biggest brands were segmented by product type. A soda brand like Coca-Cola makes sugary beverages and snack foods. It had strong brand recognition in that product sector, but the company never sought to branch out into household goods like laundry detergent and batteries.\n\nCostco pressed ahead anyway and settled on \"Kirkland\" because the company is headquartered in Kirkland, Washington. Today, Kirkland has over 350 products on Costco shelves and generated $86 billion in sales last year. Incidentally, the presence of Kirkland products has also increased Costco's leverage in price negotiations on other products. What seemed like a big risk at the time turned into a master stroke, and Costco's stockholders are reaping the benefits.\n\nTrending: Donald Trump just announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure deal \u2014 here's how you can invest in the entertainment market's next big disruptor at $2.25 per share.\n\nCostco's co-founder, Jim Sinegal told the Journal that the company's original business model was to offer a carefully curated set of brands in each consumer category at a discount and move the products in high volume.

    "finetuned_summary": "Costco's house brand, Kirkland, has become an 86 billion retail powerhouse that offers an incredibly diverse product line that ranges from dress shirts to high-end liquor. The Wall Street Journal detailed how Costco turned what seemed like a big gamble into a master stroke. It's not uncommon for major supermarkets to have a house brand for their products, but few if any can match the brand loyalty or market share of Costco's NASDAQ: COST"

    "summary": "Given steady rates and economic uncertainty, WFC may face headwinds in the near term. Read on to know whether the stock is worth holding on to for now.",
    "text": "The Federal Reserve opted to keep interest rates steady, following the conclusion of its two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting yesterday, given the rising risks of inflation and unemployment because of heightened economic uncertainty on the back of Trump's tariff plan. The resulting higher-for-longer interest rate backdrop can pose new challenges for banks like Wells Fargo & Company WFC.\n\nFor Wells Fargo, the unchanged rates may not offer the relief many investors had expected. Given mounting concerns, let us try to decipher whether the WFC stock is worth holding on to in the current scenario.\n\nWells Fargo & Fed Rates\n\nLast year, the Federal Reserve lowered the interest rates by 100 basis points but has kept them steady since then. Wells Fargo's net interest income (NII) and net interest margin (NIM) have been subdued by the increased funding costs as the high-interest rate environment weighed on it, as evident by declines in NII and NIM in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWith no change in interest rates for now, WFC will likely face extended periods of elevated funding costs. As economic growth is likely to be subdued, the lending scenario is not expected to improve much in 2025 from 2024. With interest rates remaining high for long, the operating backdrop for WFC will likely be challenging. Weak asset quality will continue to be a major headwind this year, as borrowers may find it difficult to repay loans.\n\nHence, Wells Fargo may witness modest growth in the near term. Management expects the 2025 NII to be 1-3% higher than that reported in 2024.\n\nOther Factors Aiding WFC\n\nProgress to Fix Compliance Issues: Under the leadership of CEO Charlie Scharf, Wells Fargo is strengthening its compliance framework. The bank's improved risk management techniques have received regulatory approval, with progress closely monitored by its operating committee.\n\nThe company has managed to close six regulatory actions this year and 12 since 2019. This demonstrates that strengthening risk management and compliance infrastructure continues to be the mainstay of WFC\u2019s operational strategy.\n\nWells Fargo is operating under an asset cap of $1.95 trillion imposed in 2018 following the revelation of its fake account scandal. In March, Reuters reported that investors and analysts are more hopeful that the asset cap will be lifted later this year following the bank's progress in resolving multiple consent orders.\n\nBecause of the asset cap, the company is unable to grow to its potential. This is affecting its loan growth. Given that loans are among the largest assets a bank can hold, lifting the asset cap will mark a turning point for Wells Fargo.",

    "text": "Ferrari (RACE) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.42 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.12 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.54%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this luxury sports car maker would post earnings of $1.89 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.28, delivering a surprise of 20.63%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nFerrari , which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Original Equipment industry, posted revenues of $1.88 billion for the quarter ended March 2025, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.99%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.72 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nFerrari shares have added about 9.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -3.9%.\n\nWhat's Next for Ferrari?\n\nWhile Ferrari has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ferrari: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

    "text": "May 13 - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is no longer on Wedbush's Best Ideas List, as the firm sees rising uncertainty around how artificial intelligence could reshape the company's core business.\n\nAnalysts still see long-term value in the stock.

Together, Coca-Cola and American Express write a check to Berkshire Hathaway for more than $1 billion annually just in dividends, while their combined stocks have increased from a total investment of $2.6 billion to around $50 billion.\n\nOver the years, Buffett has singled out these two stocks by name in many instances. There are some specific characteristics he loves about them:\n\nCoca-Cola and American Express are Berkshire Hathaway's longest-held equity positions. It first bought Coca-Cola stock in 1988 and American Express in 1991, and it finished buying them in 1994 and 1995, respectively.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway has already sold around half of its position in Apple over the past year or so, although it's still the largest position by far, accounting for around 22% of the total. He hasn't touched a share of Coca-Cola or American Express, though. With Buffett stepping down and Greg Abel taking over, could these stocks be on the chopping block?\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has an equity portfolio that typically features around 50 stocks, but CEO Warren Buffett definitely plays favorites. There are a select few stocks that he has praised over and over again and that he said he'd never sell while he was in charge, including Apple , Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and American Express (NYSE: AXP).\n\nNone of the management team is changing at Berkshire Hathaway, and they were all trained under Buffett's watch.\n\nGreg Abel is taking over the business, but he has been responsible for the non-insurance owned businesses until now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWill Greg Abel change things up at Berkshire Hathaway?\n\nThe market doesn't know so much about Abel right now because he mostly stays under the radar. Although he's been a part of Berkshire Hathaway for 25 years, he was brought on board as a vice chairman in 2018 and named Buffett's successor in 2021.\n\nOn the one hand, Abel has been in charge of all non-insurance businesses for several years, and that management style is already being implemented. However, the equity portfolio is in the hands of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, while Abel and Ajit Jain have run the owned-business side of things. If that business setup stays in place, Abel may not take a big stance on investing decisions, leaving it to the current duo. As it stands today, they may be making more calls than Buffett on equity positions. Buffett told investors that it was one of his managers who made the decision to purchase Amazon stock in 2019, not his, and that probably applies to a lot of the company's recent trades. Without Buffett in the picture, or at least without him on top, since he said he'll still stick around, the investing team may be more comfortable making other bold stock trades that are slightly outside of Buffett's box.\n\nBuffett has said several times recently that as Berkshire gets bigger, it's harder to move the needle. When asked at the meeting last week how he would spend $10 billion in today's market, he brushed it off, saying it wouldn't do much. Abel could make some macro decisions that guide the investing team differently than how they handle the stock portfolio today, and is likely to develop his own leadership style.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't expect anything revolutionary at Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett's investing has made Berkshire Hathaway into what it is today, and the current team, who have been trained under his watch, isn't changing.\n\nSo will the new management sell Coca-Cola or American Express? Both of these companies have been performing fabulously right now, for all the reasons Buffett loves them, so it doesn't seem likely in the near term.

      "There are a select few stocks that he has praised over and over again and that he said he'd never sell while he was in charge, including Apple , Coca-Cola NYSE: KO , and American Express NYSE: AXP .",
      "None of the management team is changing at Berkshire Hathaway, and they were all trained under Buffett's watch.",
      "Greg Abel is taking over the business, but he has been responsible for the non-insurance owned businesses until now.",
      "Story Continues Will Greg Abel change things up at Berkshire Hathaway?",
      "The market doesn't know so much about Abel right now because he mostly stays under the radar.",
      "Although he's been a part of Berkshire Hathaway for 25 years, he was brought on board as a vice chairman in 2018 and named Buffett's successor in 2021.",
      "On the one hand, Abel has been in charge of all non-insurance businesses for several years, and that management style is already being implemented.",
      "However, the equity portfolio is in the hands of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, while Abel and Ajit Jain have run the owned-business side of things.",
      "If that business setup stays in place, Abel may not take a big stance on investing decisions, leaving it to the current duo.",
      "As it stands today, they may be making more calls than Buffett on equity positions.",
      "Buffett told investors that it was one of his managers who made the decision to purchase Amazon stock in 2019, not his, and that probably applies to a lot of the company's recent trades.",
      "Without Buffett in the picture, or at least without him on top, since he said he'll still stick around, the investing team may be more comfortable making other bold stock trades that are slightly outside of Buffett's box.",
      "Buffett has said several times recently that as Berkshire gets bigger, it's harder to move the needle.",
      "When asked at the meeting last week how he would spend 10 billion in today's market, he brushed it off, saying it wouldn't do much.",
      "Abel could make some macro decisions that guide the investing team differently than how they handle the stock portfolio today, and is likely to develop his own leadership style.",
      "However, I wouldn't expect anything revolutionary at Berkshire Hathaway.",
      "Buffett's investing has made Berkshire Hathaway into what it is today, and the current team, who have been trained under his watch, isn't changing.",
      "So will the new management sell Coca-Cola or American Express?",
      "Both of these companies have been performing fabulously right now, for all the reasons Buffett loves them, so it doesn't seem likely in the near term.",
      "But Abel hasn't committed to them the way Buffett has, and it's certainly a possibility at some future time.",
      "Should you invest 1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?",
      "Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now and Coca-Cola wasn t one of them.",
      "The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.",
      "Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested 1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you d have 623,103!",
      "Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested 1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you d have 717,471!",
      "Now, it s worth noting Stock Advisor s total average return is 909 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 162 for the S P 500.",
      "Don t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.",

Tariffs on exports to China will fall to 10%.\n\nU.S. consumer goods retailers will benefit from the move, though it's unclear if the changes are temporary or permanent.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Kohl's \u203a\n\nMonday dawned bright for investors after President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that the U.S. has struck a deal with China to dramatically -- if temporarily -- roll back some of the tidal wave of new tariffs that the two nations had imposed on each other over the past several weeks. The U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day pause on post-April 2 tariffs, which will reduce the tariff rate on imported Chinese goods to 30%, and on exported U.S. goods to 10%.\n\nMajor U.S. importers of China-made wares rejoiced, and shares of their stocks popped. As of 9:45 a.m. ET, hardware store chain Lowe's Companies is up 4.6%, tool-maker Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK) is up 14.6%, and department store chain Kohl's Corp. (NYSE: KSS) is a bit in between, up 12.4%.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nToday in tariffs news\n\nIs it just me, or does every move in the stock market lately seem to depend on which way tariff rates are headed? (Hint: It's not just me.)\n\nIf you are trying to make heads or tails of the situation, here's another hint, courtesy of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Explaining the decision to flip-flop on roughly four-fifths of the tariffs the administration put in place barely a month ago this morning, Bessent said that the big-picture goal of all this tariffs shuffling is \"decoupling\" the U.S. economy from China -- but only to an extent. \"We do not want a generalized decoupling from China,\" said Bessent in an interview with CNBC. \"What we do want is a decoupling for strategic necessities, which we were unable to obtain during COVID and we realized that efficient supply chains were not resilient supply chains.\"\n\nIt probably remains to be seen precisely which Chinese goods the U.S. will end up deeming \"strategic\" such that we want to ensure they're made in the USA, and not imported abroad. But cheap, labor-intensive everyday consumer goods such as you shop for every week from stores like Lowe's and Kohl's? Those seem to be fine, and the administration isn't going to shut off trade in those items entirely (as a 145% tariff rate would have ensured). Instead, a more moderate 30% rate will suffice.\n\nAssuming I'm reading these tea leaves correctly, therefore, it would seem that investors over-read the risk of tariffs on low-tech imports remaining permanent, and perhaps sold off stocks dependent on such imports too much -- because they were never going to remain super-high permanently. This would therefore also suggest that investors' enthusiasm over today's news, for these three stocks at least, is justified.",

As of 9:45 a.m. ET, hardware store chain Lowe's Companies is up 4.6 , tool-maker Stanley Black Decker NYSE: SWK is up 14.6 , and department store chain Kohl's Corp. NYSE: KSS is a bit in between, up 12.4 . Image source: Getty Images. Today in tariffs news Is it just me, or does every move in the stock market lately seem to depend on which way tariff rates are headed? Hint: It's not just me. If you are trying to make heads or tails of the situation, here's another hint, courtesy of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Explaining the decision to flip-flop on roughly four-fifths of the tariffs the administration put in place barely a month ago this morning, Bessent said that the big-picture goal of all this tariffs shuffling is \"decoupling\" the U.S. economy from China -- but only to an extent. \"We do not want a generalized decoupling from China,\" said Bessent in an interview with CNBC. \"What we do want is a decoupling for strategic necessities, which we were unable to obtain during COVID and we realized that efficient supply chains were not resilient supply chains.\" It probably remains to be seen precisely which Chinese goods the U.S. will end up deeming \"strategic\" such that we want to ensure they're made in the USA, and not imported abroad. But cheap, labor-intensive everyday consumer goods such as you shop for every week from stores like Lowe's and Kohl's? Those seem to be fine, and the administration isn't going to shut off trade in those items entirely as a 145 tariff rate would have ensured . Instead, a more moderate 30 rate will suffice. Assuming I'm reading these tea leaves correctly, therefore, it would seem that investors over-read the risk of tariffs on low-tech imports remaining permanent, and perhaps sold off stocks dependent on such imports too much -- because they were never going to remain super-high permanently. This would therefore also suggest that investors' enthusiasm over today's news, for these three stocks at least, is justified.",

    "finetuned_summary": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has sent a list of questions to the company. It's part of an ongoing investigation into Tesla's Full Self-Driving software. The agency wants to understand how the system performs in tough conditions, like fog, rain, or bright sun. It also asked how Tesla plans to test its robotaxis safely on public roads. This probe started back in October 2024 after four crashes tied to the FSD system in low-visibility settings. Right now, Tesla's FSD still needs drivers to stay alert and keep their hands on the wheel. But CEO Elon Musk says the upcoming robotaxi version will drive without supervision."

De los Santos explained, \u201cWe do not manage the business to a short-term margin goal; our emphasis is on capturing long-term growth opportunities in commerce and fintech.\u201d Management acknowledged that further investments\u2014especially in logistics, credit products, and promotional activity\u2014could lead to short-term margin pressures, but views these as necessary to sustain the company\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nKey Insights from Management\u2019s Remarks\n\nManagement\u2019s remarks provided context for the quarter\u2019s outperformance, driven by innovation in financial products, improved logistics, and strategic focus on high-growth categories.

Uh, we've got those details with Yahoo Finance senior reporter, Anjalee Khemlani, here. Anjalee, we're waiting for comments around what this drug pricing and the details around that would look like from the executive order. What is the best assessment that you're hearing across Wall Street right now?\n\n00:17 Anjalee Khemlani\n\nYeah, I would say that analysts are pretty wary about the implementation of this and questions are still swirling about whether or not this is going to have the impact that the administration wants. We have had some insight into what it is going to be in this executive order. White House officials did talk to reporters earlier today and I have some of that for you. Take a look at what we've got. Uh, we know that last night, President Trump did post on Truth Social about what is expected, lowering prices up to 80%. But what we do know is that this executive order is going to have sort of a multi-pronged approach. First of all, employing USTR and Commerce Department to take a look at what is happening overseas and ensure that the US companies are being protected against what they call discriminatory practices from, from countries that are negotiating those lower prices. Then they've also got the Department of Justice and FTC looking at anti-competitive practice, either here or abroad, looking at where they can, uh, look at M&A deals, scrutinize how these companies are doing business and whether they themselves are responsible for those high prices and what other levers here in the US are doing that. Meanwhile, the FDA would be charged with expanding importation from abroad. We already know that that is in place for Canada. That is from Trump's last administration move and he's looking at expanding that to other countries as well to gain access to those lower prices. In addition, the Health and Human Services department would negotiate with the companies those lower market prices, matching the most favored nation. And if you recall, most favored nation being that one, one or, you know, those countries that have the lowest prices for any one drug that does include GLP1s. We know that's going to be part of the target. In addition, uh, the, the question about whether or not this would then erase that pressure of pharma tariffs does not go away. It looks like the administration is still focused on that investigation into national security and whether or not essential medicines need to be onshore and more focus needs to be put on the supply chain being onshore back here in the US. I did also ask about, uh, you know, what the thought process is here and we heard from those officials saying that what they're looking at is fixing the market and market forces. So, that seems to be the main focus. Uh, they did talk a little bit about rule making. So, that would include bringing in Congress. There does seem to be very little appetite on the Hill for anything to do with this, Republicans included. And the industry has been largely quiet till now, but they have been pushing back against this and it looks like this could be sort of the next battle legally in courts and also policy-wise.",

This platform produces very stable and growing cash flows for the master limited partnership (MLP). That enables it to pay investors a lucrative and growing cash distribution (8% current yield).\n\nThat high-yielding payout is on a rock-solid foundation, which was clear in the MLP's recent first-quarter earnings report. That report also showed the company has ample fuel to continue growing its payout. These factors continue to make Energy Transfer a no-brainer buy for those seeking passive income and who are comfortable investing in MLPs, which send a Schedule K-1 Federal Tax Form each year, taking some extra work at tax time.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nAnother solid quarter\n\nEnergy Transfer's diversified midstream business delivered solid first-quarter results. The MLP generated $4.1 billion of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) during the period, a 5% increase from last year's first quarter. Meanwhile, it produced over $2.3 billion of distributable cash flow, down slightly from less than $2.4 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nThat was enough cash to cover its high-yielding payout with almost $1.2 billion to spare, even though it has increased its distribution per unit by more than 3% over the past year. The MLP used its excess free cash flow to fund growth capital projects (nearly $950 million in the quarter) and maintain its rock-solid balance sheet. Its leverage ratio continues to be in the lower half of its 4.0-4.5 target range.\n\nThe company delivered solid operating results across its various business segments. Crude oil transportation volumes were up 10%, natural gas liquids volumes increased by a mid-single-digit rate, and interstate natural gas transportation volumes rose 3% to a new partnership record. The MLP benefited from continued strong demand, recently completed expansion projects, and the impact of last year's acquisition of WTG Midstream.\n\nMore growth ahead\n\nEnergy Transfer's solid first-quarter showing kept it on track to achieve its full-year earnings forecast. The MLP expects its adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.5 billion this year, a 5% increase from last year at the midpoint.\n\nThe company also plans to invest about $5 billion into growth capital projects this year. It recently started construction on the Hugh Brinson Pipeline, which will transport natural gas produced in the Permian Basin to market centers in Texas. The first phase of the potential $2.7 billion project should enter commercial service at the end of 2026. That's one of several major growth capital projects the company has under construction that should enter service by the end of next year. They'll provide the company with significant incremental earnings and cash flow in the 2026 to 2027 time frame.",

(NYSE:NEE) stands against other stocks that will make you rich in 3 years.\n\nIs the Bull Market Over?\n\nThe stock market has been facing volatility since the tariffs were announced. This has created fears of a recession, leading many investors to think that this might be the end of the bull market. On April 29, Andrew Simmon, Head of Applied Equity Advisor Team at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, released a note explaining that the bull market may not have finished yet.\n\nSimmon noted that the stock market took big swings earlier this year, which has hampered investor enthusiasm. However, this also presents a better outlook as compared to the start of the year, as now the bullish side of the market is weighing less. Simmon believes that this presents an attractive buying opportunity to get into the market at fairly discounted prices. He highlighted that the investment management firm had already anticipated 2025 to be a pause year for the S&P 500, with single-digit gains for investors. The third year of bull markets is usually mediocre, however, it still has the potential to produce single-digit gains, with greater volatility.\n\nThe Head of Applied Equity team highlighted that volatility has been one of the main characteristics of the market since the announcement of planned global tariffs. He noted that a decline of 20% from the peak would have indicated a bull market, however, the market pulled back and gained 10% on April 9, after the announcement of some tariffs being pulled back. Citing a statistical study, Simmon noted that according to an analysis, 9 out of 12 times when the S&P 500 has fallen more than 20%, it has brought a recession along with it. However, under the current situation, it seems that the \u201cTrump Put\u201d came into play as the recession talks started to spur the market.\n\nWhile explaining the investment thesis for volatile times, Simmons acknowledged that investing in these times can be stressful, however, the key here is to follow the pattern as a guide. The pattern shows that when the S&P 500 is down 15%, it is a good time to enter the market. He explained that the S&P 500 has fallen 15% around 18 times since 1950, and the one-year return after the drop has been 14%, thereby making it an attractive entry point. Simmon concluded by noting that although there is no guarantee, however, historic trends have shown that when the markets go down, it is a good time to move against the headlines and increase stake in equities. This is because, as per the trends, a downturn often indicates that the odds of getting greater returns are getting better.",

    "text": "What Happened?\n\nShares of latin American e-commerce and fintech company MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) jumped 7.3% in the afternoon session after the company reported impressive first-quarter 2025 results, which significantly blew past analysts' revenue, EPS, and EBITDA expectations.\n\nThe key highlight for the quarter was Argentina's staggering revenue growth of 184%, powered by triple-digit expansion in gross merchandise volume and a sharp rebound in consumer demand. As a result, sales climbed 37% from the previous year. Profits also improved meaningfully, aided by scale efficiencies and lower fulfillment costs per order in major markets like Brazil and Mexico. The EPS beat was a direct result of these gains, reflecting improved execution despite currency headwinds in Brazil and investment drag in Mexico.\n\nOverall, it was a strong quarter for MercadoLibre, driven by outsized growth in Argentina, resilient consumer demand, and encouraging momentum in fintech and advertising, despite mixed buyer metrics.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $2,411, up 6.2% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy MercadoLibre? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nMercadoLibre\u2019s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 10 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago when the stock dropped 16.3% on the news that the company reported weaker third-quarter earnings.\n\nThe main reason was that it missed on operating income margin because it ramped up investments in its credit and logistics businesses. Ramping up loan originations leads to the recognition of the allowance for doubtful accounts upfront (the expected losses on the loans). However, the new loan originations came from credit cards and moving up-market to higher-quality customers. Because these new accounts have lower default risk, the yields are lower and result in a lower blended NIMAL spread (aka margins). The new loans are additive to overall profit dollars, lower the risk of the broader credit portfolio, and increase MELI's market share and stickiness/wallet share with customers.\n\nOn the other hand, MercadoLibre delivered impressive revenue growth this quarter. Overall, the stock is reacting to the bottom line miss.\n\nMercadoLibre is up 36.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $2,407 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of MercadoLibre\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,068.\n\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.

    "summary": "Here\u2019s what happened to anti-DEI proposals put before shareholders at several U.S. companies, including Apple, Goldman Sachs, and Costco.",
    "text": "The outcome: The NCPPR proposal was rejected by 97% of shareholders, with 1% abstaining and 1% supporting the proposal.\n\nBut in its proxy statement , Bristol Myers Squibb urged shareholders to reject the NCPPR\u2019s proposal, and the drugmaker\u2019s board explained its point of view on diversity in no uncertain terms: \u201cWe value inclusion and prioritize building an inclusive workforce in compliance with applicable non-discrimination laws, as do our shareholders,\u201d it wrote. \u201cWe believe our inclusion philosophy leads to greater financial and patient outcomes and generates shareholder value, because it helps drive our strategic goal to reach more patients with our transformative medicines.\u201d\n\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative activist shareholder group, submitted a proposal asking that BMS \u201ccease DEI efforts,\u201d calling the practices discriminatory and suggesting it put the company at risk of discrimination lawsuits. That\u2019s a common argument made in several anti-DEI proposals, with the activists citing the Supreme Court ruling that struck down affirmative action in college admissions as a warning for private sector companies practicing DEI.\n\nBelow is a look at how some DEI proposals have fared so far this proxy season.\n\nTo be sure, that has been true in previous years, too. As a general rule, shareholders rarely vote in favor of politically and socially motivated proposals, preferring to let corporate executives make decisions in such realms. Still, the fact that these proposals have landed with a notable thud in such a pivotal year shows a specific kind of corporate resistance to major politicians and anti-DEI crusaders.\n\nThis culture shift was the backdrop to several recent anti-DEI shareholder votes at companies ranging from Coca-Cola to Apple , as activists tried to ramp up the fight over diversity and inclusion policies. But while anti-DEI proposals have become more common , they are not gaining in popularity. At companies ranging from Coca-Cola to Apple, investors asked to vote on anti-DEI resolutions are not biting. Across the board, support for these proposals has ranged from only 1% to 2% of voters.\n\nNo matter where you stand politically, it\u2019s hard to deny that it\u2019s been a banner year for the anti-DEI movement: President Donald Trump has issued executive orders designed to stamp out diversity practices in both the private and public sector, and several large companies have rolled back their DEI programs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAhead of its May meeting, Berkshire Hathaway sought to exclude a proposal from the NCPPR which asked the company to perform a legal audit of its race-based initiatives, suggesting that the company\u2019s DEI policies were putting it at risk of lawsuits.\n\nBerkshire\u2019s letter to the SEC requesting to omit the proposal\u2014called a \u201cno-action letter\u201d\u2014cited studies on the benefits of diversity, and included a quote from CEO Warren Buffett speaking at Berkshire\u2019s 2023 annual meeting: \u201cIf [I] had been born Black, a woman, or in a different country, [I] wouldn\u2019t nearly [have] enjoyed the same type of life [I] have].\u201d\n\nThe company wasn\u2019t successful in blocking the proposal from this year\u2019s meeting. But in its proxy statement, the board wrote that a legal audit wasn\u2019t necessary and that its policies allow managers to enact programs they see as appropriate for their businesses while complying with the law. It also said that monitoring risks, including social risks, was the duty of Berkshire\u2019s Audit Committee.\n\nThe outcome: At what turned out to be a historic shareholder meeting, with Buffett announcing his plans to step down, shareholders rejected this anti-DEI proposal and a similar one. Both received less than 1% of voters\u2019 support.\n\n\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nShareholder meeting date: May 1, 2025\n\nLast year, the conservative activist group National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) submitted a proposal asking the iconic American company to review and consider its executive pay, as well as its DEI hiring goals. Coca-Cola, in a letter filed to SEC, defended its policies and looked to block the proposal from its annual meeting. The beverage giant argued that it seeks to mirror the markets it serves, in order to maximize its performance. The company also said it wanted its workforce diversity to be aligned with U.S. census data.\n\nThe proposal made it to the vote. So in its 2025 proxy statement, Coca-Cola\u2019s board pointed out that the NLPC proposal technically asked the company to do something it was already doing on a regular basis.\n\nThe outcome:\n\nOnly 1.1o% of shareholders supported the NLPC\u2019s proposal.\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nShareholder meeting date: April 24, 2025\n\nAhead of this year\u2019s proxy voting season, the NLPC submitted shareholder proposals to Goldman Sachs over its diversity aspirations and executive pay incentives, including the compensation of CEO David Solomon.\n\n\u201cWe believe that diversity, including diversity of thought, experience and perspectives, is important to our commercial success,\u201d the bank wrote in its proxy statement, suggesting that shareholders reject the NLPC\u2019s resolution. The company also said it\u2019s aware that the law on DEI matters is \u201cevolving,\u201d but that Goldmany is staying on top of changes and had already reviewed and revised some programs where necessary. The bank also said the NLPC had mischaracterized its pay incentive plans.\n\nThe outcome: 98% of shareholders in the investment bank rejected the conservative proposals.\n\n\n\nLevi\u2019s\n\nShareholder meeting date: April 23, 2025\n\nThe NCPPR had asked Levi\u2019s investors to back a resolution asking the clothing maker to \u201cconsider abolishing its DEI program, policies, department, and goals.\u201d\n\nBut Levi\u2019s has made diversity a core value for years. The Levi\u2019s board explained as much in this year\u2019s proxy statement, spelling out its philosophy on diversity in the workplace. \u201c[W]e believe in the strong business case for a diverse and inclusive workforce because it supports company performance and also enhances our culture and the well-being of those who make our Company thrive: our employees.\u201d\n\nThe outcome: Less than 1% of shareholders support the anti-DEI proposal.\n\n\n\nDeere and Co.\n\nShareholder meeting date: Feb. 25, 2025\n\nLast July, Deere famously scaled back its diversity programs, after becoming the focus of an online campaign by conservative influencer Robby Starbuck. The NLPC had also submitted a shareholder proposal asking Deere to produce a report on its racial and gender hiring statistics. As with other resolutions, the NLPC said that stressing diversity in hiring leaves companies open to legal challenges from employees, including white employees who may feel that they are the victims of discrimination.\n\nDeere asked shareholders to vote against the resolution in its 2025 proxy statement \u201cbecause Deere is committed to treating our employees, who propel us toward achieving our business ambitions, fairly and inclusively.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe outcome: Only 1.3% of voters were in favor of the resolution.\n\n\n\nApple\n\nShareholder meeting date: Feb. 25, 2025\n\nAhead of its annual meeting, Apple asked its shareholders to reject a proposal from the conservative advocacy group NCPPR, which stated the tech company should cease all DEI-related activities, including its diverse supplier programs. In its 2025 proxy statement, Apple wrote: \u201cWe strive to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\u201d\n\nIn its \u201cno action\u201d request to the SEC, Apple made several arguments against including the proposal at its general meeting, including that the resolution amounted to micromanaging. They were unsuccessful, and NCPPR\u2019s proposal was put to a vote.\n\nThe outcome: More than 97% of shareholders sided with Apple, voting against the NCPPR\u2019s resolution.\n\n\n\nCostco\n\nShareholder meeting date: Jan. 23, 2025\n\nCostco was the first major company to face an anti-DEI proposal this year. In 2024, the NCPPR filed a proposal about Costco\u2019s DEI programs, saying that the company had rebranded its policies but still employed a chief diversity officer, maintained a supplier diversity program, and appeared to still consider DEI in hiring and promotion practices.\n\nThe retailer\u2019s response was unequivocal in its pro-DEI stance. In its proxy statement, the board explained that it saw diversity and inclusion as part of its secret to success, and as a key part of how Costco attracts and retains employees, and meets customer needs. \u201cAs our membership diversifies, we believe that serving it with a diverse group of employees enhances satisfaction. Among other things, a diverse group of employees helps bring originality and creativity to our merchandise offerings, promoting the \u2018treasure hunt\u2019 that our customers value,\u201d the company wrote.\n\nCostco also questioned the motivation behind the proposal, stating: \u201cThe proponent's broader agenda is not reducing risk for the company, but abolition of diversity initiatives.\u201d\n\nThe outcome: Only 2% of voters supported the anti-DEI resolution, and Costco gained some customer fans.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

A: We aim to reduce all tenant exposures below 5% by October 31, 2025, with Walgreens targeted below 3%. There is strong interest from institutions and 1031 buyers for Dollar Stores, and we expect to continue progress in reducing exposure to Dollar General and Family Dollar. We also plan to sell some pharmacy properties before the next earnings call.\n\nQ: What are your expectations regarding a potential ratings upgrade and the associated debt savings? A: We plan to approach rating agencies in the latter half of this year. Achieving an investment-grade credit rating could result in about 30 basis points of savings across our term loans and credit facility.\n\nQ: Could you clarify your net investment activity and any changes in the transaction market since April 2? A: We would not increase acquisitions without an improvement in our equity price. The transaction market has not changed significantly since April 2, and we continue to see many opportunities, particularly in convenience stores, quick service restaurants, and auto service sectors.\n\nQ: What is the status of the Big Lots asset in Maryland, and is it included in your guidance? A: We have received interest from several retailers and are negotiating attractive LOIs. We expect a better outcome by taking our time. This asset is not included in our 2025 guidance.\n\nQ: How does the Walgreens take-private transaction affect the risk profile of those assets? A: The transaction does not change the risk profile. Sycamore's focus on retail operations and a lower leverage approach is positive. We expect Walgreens to remain a going concern, and our locations are performing well.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n",

We expect a better outcome by taking our time. This asset is not included in our 2025 guidance. Q: How does the Walgreens take-private transaction affect the risk profile of those assets? A: The transaction does not change the risk profile. Sycamore's focus on retail operations and a lower leverage approach is positive. We expect Walgreens to remain a going concern, and our locations are performing well. For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.

    "summary": "Many investors are wondering how payments and financial services stocks like Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and American Express (AXP) are holding up amid macro challenges and heightened economic uncertainty around the world, which one would expect to hamper their businesses. However, it turns out they\u2019re faring pretty well. Let\u2019s examine these three major financial services providers and their recent results to determine which are attractive opportunities for investors. As things stand, TipRanks\u2019 A",
    "text": "Visa is also a dividend stock, though its yield of 0.64% is below the S&P 500\u2019s 1.4%. But look beyond the low yield; it is a compelling dividend growth stock. The company has paid dividends for the past 16 years in a row and has increased its payout in each of those 16 years (each year since going public). Visa has increased its payout by a substantial 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past five years. With a low dividend payout ratio of just 21.5%, Visa has plenty of room to continue raising its payout for the foreseeable future.\n\nVisa is a long-standing company performing well in a difficult environment, and its valuation reflects this. Priced at 30.8x 2025 earnings estimates, Visa\u2019s valuation is on the higher end, trading at a premium to the broader market; the S&P 500 (SPX) currently trades for roughly 20x forward earnings estimates. However, it\u2019s not as if this is an egregious, nosebleed valuation, especially for a long-term winner like Visa.\n\nFurthermore, one might expect the global malaise to dampen international travel (a key driver for Visa\u2019s business). Still, the company reported that cross-border payment volume increased by an impressive 13% year-over-year. One might expect that Visa\u2019s growth in terms of transactions would be saturated at this point, but this isn\u2019t the case at all. The company processed 60.7 billion transactions, representing a strong 9% year-over-year increase.\n\nDespite potential headwinds created by the unfolding tariff situation, which could have crimped consumer demand, Visa posted impressive 9% net revenue growth. CEO Ryan McInerney reported that \u201cVisa\u2019s strong 9% fiscal second quarter net revenue growth was driven by healthy trends in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. Consumer spending remained resilient, even with macroeconomic uncertainty.\u201d\n\nVisa recently reported second-quarter results, and based on its strong performance, one would hardly expect any hint of a potential slowdown.\n\nLet\u2019s examine these three major financial services providers and their recent results to determine which are attractive opportunities for investors. As things stand, TipRanks\u2019 AI analysis rates all three credit card giants as Outperform .\n\nMany investors are wondering how payments and financial services stocks like Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and American Express (AXP) are holding up amid macro challenges and heightened economic uncertainty around the world, which one would expect to hamper their businesses. However, it turns out they\u2019re faring pretty well.\n\nStory Continues\n\nVisa is also bolstering these returns to shareholders with share buybacks. During the quarter, Visa repurchased 13 million shares of its class A stock at an average cost of $340.26 per share, for $4.5 billion. In total, Visa returned $5.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nIn April, Visa\u2019s Board of Directors authorized a new $30 billion multi-year share repurchase program. As the company continues to reduce its outstanding shares over time, the remaining shares theoretically become more valuable as Visa\u2019s earnings are divided among fewer shareholders.\n\nIs Visa a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, Visa earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst V stock price target of $379.71 implies 8.5% upside potential from current levels.\n\nI\u2019m bullish on Visa based on its impressive results, which demonstrate its resilience during a challenging time for many businesses. While the stock\u2019s valuation is higher, it isn\u2019t egregiously expensive for such a high-quality, dominant stock. I like Visa\u2019s method of rewarding its investors through a combination of dividend growth and reducing its share count over time through share buybacks, which should continue to serve investors well going forward.\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA)\n\nMastercard and Visa are essentially the \u201c1A\u201d and \u201c1B\u201d in the global payment rails space, and there is little separating the companies in terms of their business models.\n\nLike Visa, Mastercard overcame any macro challenges to post impressive quarterly results. During the first quarter, Mastercard generated net revenue of $7.3 billion, an impressive 14% year-over-year increase. CEO Michael Miebach also touted the company\u2019s impressive 15% cross-border payment growth, assuaging fears about a slowdown in international travel and spending. Additionally, the company grew its total dollar volume by 9% year-over-year, so like Visa, Mastercard is firing on all cylinders despite the fears over a looming recession.\n\nMastercard trades for 35x 2025 earnings estimates, meaning it trades at a premium to both Visa and the broader market. This isn\u2019t excessive for a high-quality company like Mastercard, but Visa offers a slightly better value.\n\nLike Visa, Mastercard is a dividend stock with a relatively low 0.51% yield. Like Visa, it\u2019s also an appealing dividend growth stock\u2014Mastercard has grown its dividend for 18 years in a row and grown its payout for the past 13 years in a row. Mastercard has grown its dividend at a strong 14.2% CAGR over the past five years. It also features a low payout ratio of 18.9%, meaning there is plenty of room for further dividend growth.\n\nMoreover, Mastercard is bolstering its returns to shareholders with a flurry of share buybacks. During the first quarter, Mastercard bought back 4.7 million shares for $2.5 billion, in addition to the $694 million it paid out in dividends.\n\nIs Mastercard a Buy or Sell Stock?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, MA earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 18 Buys, two Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst MA stock price target of $634.76 implies 12% upside potential from current levels.\n\nLike Visa, Mastercard\u2019s valuation is a bit high. Still, I view the stock favorably based on its excellent recent results during a trying time, and its compelling combination of share buybacks and dividend growth.\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP)\n\nLast but certainly not least, let\u2019s examine American Express. The company also recently released quarterly results, and its performance was impressive.\n\nAmerican Express reported that its total revenue of $17 billion increased by 8% year-over-year as billed business grew 6% to $387.4 billion and total card member spending grew 6%. Like Visa and Mastercard, American Express has proved to be a resilient business that has navigated the current macroeconomic challenges well.\n\nOn that note, CEO Stephen J. Squeri assuaged investor fears by reporting that while the company saw a sequential slowdown in airlines billing growth, \u201cbillings in restaurants and lodging remained strong in the quarter, and overall T&E (travel and entertainment) growth was in line with the steady levels we saw through most of last year.\u201d\n\nSqueri also found that T&E spending looked healthy through early April, when we were in the thick of the tariff malaise. American Express also believes its affluent, premium customer base will help it weather any economic storm. Squeri reminds investors that the company\u2019s \u201ccard members at high incomes are loyal, high spending, and have excellent credit profiles.\u201d Overall, management felt confident enough to maintain its full-year revenue and earnings per share guidance.\n\nWith its valuation, American Express is undemanding. Shares trade for 18.2x 2025 earnings estimates, representing a slight discount to the broader market and a steep discount to Visa and Mastercard. However, it should be noted that American Express has a different business model from these companies and features credit risk that Visa and Mastercard do not have exposure to, so some discount is understandable. Either way, it looks like an attractive valuation for American Express on a standalone basis.\n\nLike its aforementioned peers, American Express is a dividend stock, featuring a yield of 1.06%. This means that American Express sports a higher yield than Visa or Mastercard, which is roughly in line with the broader market. The company has paid a dividend for 35 years in a row, and grown it for the past three years. It features a modest payout ratio of 21.4% and has grown the dividend at an 11.7% CAGR. American Express is also returning capital to shareholders via share buybacks; the company reduced its average diluted shares outstanding by 3% during the past quarter.\n\nIs American Express a Good Stock to Buy?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, AXP earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst AXP stock price target of $288 implies 4.3% upside potential from current levels.\n\nAXP is a strong company that has executed and performed well during a turbulent time. Like its peers, it features a modest valuation and an attractive combination of dividends and share buybacks.\n\nVisa and American Express Stand Out Among Credit Card Stocks\n\nAll three of these stocks are strong options for investors. They are resilient businesses that continue to grow revenue and deliver solid results, even as many companies struggle with economic uncertainty and the threat of tariffs. Each also returns capital to shareholders through rising dividends and substantial share buybacks.\n\nPerformance Comparison between Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and American Express (AXP)\n\nGiven these strengths, I believe any of the three would make a solid investment. However, my top picks are Visa and American Express. Visa and Mastercard both operate high-quality business models as key players in the global payments network, but Visa stands out with its lower valuation and slightly higher yield, making it the more attractive of the two. I\u2019m also bullish on American Express, thanks to its combination of a cheaper valuation, higher dividend yield, and aggressive share repurchase program.\n\nDisclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

During the quarter, Visa repurchased 13 million shares of its class A stock at an average cost of 340.26 per share, for 4.5 billion. In total, Visa returned 5.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. In April, Visa s Board of Directors authorized a new 30 billion multi-year share repurchase program. As the company continues to reduce its outstanding shares over time, the remaining shares theoretically become more valuable as Visa s earnings are divided among fewer shareholders. Is Visa a Buy, Sell, or Hold? Turning to Wall Street, Visa earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst V stock price target of 379.71 implies 8.5 upside potential from current levels. I m bullish on Visa based on its impressive results, which demonstrate its resilience during a challenging time for many businesses. While the stock s valuation is higher, it isn t egregiously expensive for such a high-quality, dominant stock. I like Visa s method of rewarding its investors through a combination of dividend growth and reducing its share count over time through share buybacks, which should continue to serve investors well going forward. Mastercard NYSE:MA Mastercard and Visa are essentially the 1A and 1B in the global payment rails space, and there is little separating the companies in terms of their business models. Like Visa, Mastercard overcame any macro challenges to post impressive quarterly results. During the first quarter, Mastercard generated net revenue of 7.3 billion, an impressive 14 year-over-year increase. CEO Michael Miebach also touted the company s impressive 15 cross-border payment growth, assuaging fears about a slowdown in international travel and spending. Additionally, the company grew its total dollar volume by 9 year-over-year, so like Visa, Mastercard is firing on all cylinders despite the fears over a looming recession. Mastercard trades for 35x 2025 earnings estimates, meaning it trades at a premium to both Visa and the broader market. This isn t excessive for a high-quality company like Mastercard, but Visa offers a slightly better value. Like Visa, Mastercard is a dividend stock with a relatively low 0.51 yield. Like Visa, it s also an appealing dividend growth stock Mastercard has grown its dividend for 18 years in a row and grown its payout for the past 13 years in a row. Mastercard has grown its dividend at a strong 14.2 CAGR over the past five years. It also features a low payout ratio of 18.9 , meaning there is plenty of room for further dividend growth. Moreover, Mastercard is bolstering its returns to shareholders with a flurry of share buybacks. During the first quarter, Mastercard bought back 4.7 million shares for 2.5 billion, in addition to the 694 million it paid out in dividends. Is Mastercard a Buy or Sell Stock? Turning to Wall Street, MA earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 18 Buys, two Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst MA stock price target of 634.76 implies 12 upside potential from current levels. Like Visa, Mastercard s valuation is a bit high. Still, I view the stock favorably based on its excellent recent results during a trying time, and its compelling combination of share buybacks and dividend growth. American Express NYSE:AXP Last but certainly not least, let s examine American Express. The company also recently released quarterly results, and its performance was impressive. American Express reported that its total revenue of 17 billion increased by 8 year-over-year as billed business grew 6 to 387.4 billion and total card member spending grew 6 . Like Visa and Mastercard, American Express has proved to be a resilient business that has navigated the current macroeconomic challenges well. On that note, CEO Stephen J. Squeri assuaged investor fears by reporting that while the company saw a sequential slowdown in airlines billing growth, billings in restaurants and lodging remained strong in the quarter, and overall T E travel and entertainment growth was in line with the steady levels we saw through most of last year. Squeri also found that T E spending looked healthy through early April, when we were in the thick of the tariff malaise. American Express also believes its affluent, premium customer base will help it weather any economic storm. Squeri reminds investors that the company s card members at high incomes are loyal, high spending, and have excellent credit profiles. Overall, management felt confident enough to maintain its full-year revenue and earnings per share guidance. With its valuation, American Express is undemanding. Shares trade for 18.2x 2025 earnings estimates, representing a slight discount to the broader market and a steep discount to Visa and Mastercard. However, it should be noted that American Express has a different business model from these companies and features credit risk that Visa and Mastercard do not have exposure to, so some discount is understandable. Either way, it looks like an attractive valuation for American Express on a standalone basis. Like its aforementioned peers, American Express is a dividend stock, featuring a yield of 1.06 . This means that American Express sports a higher yield than Visa or Mastercard, which is roughly in line with the broader market. The company has paid a dividend for 35 years in a row, and grown it for the past three years. It features a modest payout ratio of 21.4 and has grown the dividend at an 11.7 CAGR. American Express is also returning capital to shareholders via share buybacks; the company reduced its average diluted shares outstanding by 3 during the past quarter. Is American Express a Good Stock to Buy? Turning to Wall Street, AXP earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst AXP stock price target of 288 implies 4.3 upside potential from current levels. AXP is a strong company that has executed and performed well during a turbulent time. Like its peers, it features a modest valuation and an attractive combination of dividends and share buybacks. Visa and American Express Stand Out Among Credit Card Stocks All three of these stocks are strong options for investors. They are resilient businesses that continue to grow revenue and deliver solid results, even as many companies struggle with economic uncertainty and the threat of tariffs. Each also returns capital to shareholders through rising dividends and substantial share buybacks. Performance Comparison between Visa V , Mastercard MA , and American Express AXP Given these strengths, I believe any of the three would make a solid investment. However, my top picks are Visa and American Express. Visa and Mastercard both operate high-quality business models as key players in the global payments network, but Visa stands out with its lower valuation and slightly higher yield, making it the more attractive of the two. I m also bullish on American Express, thanks to its combination of a cheaper valuation, higher dividend yield, and aggressive share repurchase program. Disclaimer DisclosureReport an Issue",

    "baseline_summary": "Visa is a long-standing company performing well in a difficult environment. The company has paid dividends for the past 16 years in a row and has increased its payout in each of those 16 years each year since going public. With a low dividend payout ratio of just 21.5 , Visa has plenty of room to continue raising its payout for the foreseeable future. Visa recently reported second-quarter results, and based on its strong performance, one would hardly expect any hint of a potential slowdown.",
    "finetuned_summary": "Many investors are wondering how payments and financial services stocks like Visa, Mastercard, and American Express are holding up amid macro challenges and heightened economic uncertainty around the world, which one would expect to hamper their businesses. Let's take a closer look at these three stocks to determine which of these stocks offers the most potential upside potential."

The ETF has, in fact, surged 12.9% over the past month.\n\nThe recent rebound follows a rough period for Big Tech after President Donald Trump announced a \"reciprocal tariff\" plan on April 2, which wiped out $2 trillion in cumulative market cap from the Magnificent Seven.\n\nMag-7 Stock Performance Highlights Post US-China Trade Truce\n\nAmazon and Meta Platforms spearheaded a significant rally among the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks on May 12 afternoon, following the announcement of a temporary trade truce between the United States and China.\n\nStock Performance Highlights\n\nAmazon surged 8.1% and Meta climbed 7.9% on May 12. Tesla gained 6.8%, pushing its market cap above $1 trillion. Apple rose 6.3%. NVIDIA jumped 5.4%. Google shares increased 3.4%. Microsoft added 2.4%.\n\nTrade Truce Details\n\nThe United States agreed to temporarily lower tariffs on Chinese imports. The United States cut tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China lowered American levies from 125% to 10%.\n\nThese reductions will last 90 days, following two days of high-stakes talks between the two nations. The new tariffs on small packages sent from China worth up to $800 have been cut from 120% to 54%, according to a White House statement.\n\nBullish Outlook for Tech Sector\n\nThe trade development is highly optimistic for tech stocks, particularly due to the easing of supply-chain concerns. Along with Apple, Tesla is also heavily dependent on Chinese parts and battery suppliers. No wonder, both shares surged. Moreover, Tesla is expected to debut its self-driving Taxi in June.\n\nImpact of China on Big Tech\n\nAmazon: 30% of product value on its platform comes from China; Chinese advertisers made up 14% of ad revenues in 2024, per Raymond James, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.\n\nMeta: Chinese advertisers contributed roughly 11% of total ad spending, Raymon James noted.\n\nGoogle: Chinese advertisers accounted for about 6% of ad revenues, Raymon James indicated.\n\nApple: 90% of iPhones are manufactured in China, representing 17% of 2024 revenues.\n\nNVIDIA: Chinese clients make up between 20% and 40% of the company\u2019s end customer base, according to DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.",

    "summary": "ALNY reports better-than-expected first-quarter results as both earnings and revenues beat estimates, driven by higher product sales.",
    "text": "Amvuttra generated sales worth $310 million in the first quarter, up 59% on a reported basis. The uptake for the product has been encouraging, with new patients starting treatment as well as several patients switching from Onpattro. The expanded label is also expected to boost sales in the quarters ahead. Amvuttra sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $300 million as well as our model estimate of $275.8 million.\n\nAmvuttra is FDA-approved for the treatment of adult patients with polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis. The European Commission also approved Amvuttra for treating hATTR amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 or 2 polyneuropathy. Recently, the drug has also been approved by the FDA for treating cardiomyopathy of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) in adults to reduce cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations and urgent heart failure visits. A regulatory application seeking approval of Amvuttra for the ATTR-CM indication in the EU is currently under review.\n\nOnpattro (patisiran) is approved for the treatment of polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis. The injection recorded sales of $49.5 million in the reported quarter, down 29% on a reported basis. Onpattro sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $51.2 million as well as our model estimate of $52.7 million.\n\nDespite the beat, shares of the company are down 3% on Thursday, likely because investors expected revenues to surpass expectations by a higher margin.\n\nNet revenues from collaborators were $99.2 million, down 16% from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a $65 million milestone payment received from Roche RHHBY in the year-ago quarter. Alnylam also recognizes revenues under its ongoing collaborations with Regeneron REGN and Novartis NVS.\n\nNet product revenues were $468.5 million, up 28% year over year on a reported basis and 30% at CER, driven by strong growth in patient demand for the newly approved drug, Amvuttra (vutrisiran), as well as for Givlaari (givosiran) and Oxlumo (lumasiran).\n\nAlnylam recorded total revenues of $594.2 million in the quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $588.2 million. In the year-ago quarter, total revenues were $494.3 million. The top line rose 20% year over year on a reported basis and 22% at a constant exchange rate (CER), mainly driven by increased product sales. (See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.)\n\nAlnylam Pharmaceuticals ALNY reported first-quarter 2025 adjusted loss of 1 cent per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 56 cents. The company had incurred a loss of 16 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted figure excluded items like stock-based compensation expenses and unrealized loss on marketable equity securities.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGivlaari, approved for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria, recorded sales of $67 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 15% on a reported basis. Givlaari sales marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $67.5 million and our model estimate of $68.7 million. Oxlumo recorded global net product revenues of $42.1 million in the reported quarter, which was relatively flat year over year on a reported basis.

Price and Consensus\n\nAlnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote\n\nOur Take\n\nAlnylam reported better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2025, beating earnings and revenue estimates. The year-over-year increase in revenues has been mainly fueled by growing Amvuttra sales as a result of increased patient demand. The recent label expansion of the drug for the ATTR-CM indication in the United States has further expanded the eligible patient population for the drug, which is expected to boost further sales in the quarters ahead. A nod in the EU for Amvuttra\u2019s new indication is also expected soon. Sales of other products, Givlaari and Oxlumo, are also contributing to the top line.\n\nAdditionally, Alnylam\u2019s ongoing collaboration agreements with several large biotech firms, developing candidates for various indications, are encouraging. Successful development and potential approval of these candidates will further expand the company\u2019s commercial portfolio. ALNY also earns collaboration revenues from its partners, which boost the top line. Thus, we believe that Alnylam has significant potential to boost shareholder value in the long term.\n\nALNY\u2019s Zacks Rank\n\nAlnylam currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

    "cleaned_text": "Amvuttra generated sales worth 310 million in the first quarter, up 59 on a reported basis. The uptake for the product has been encouraging, with new patients starting treatment as well as several patients switching from Onpattro. The expanded label is also expected to boost sales in the quarters ahead. Amvuttra sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 300 million as well as our model estimate of 275.8 million. Amvuttra is FDA-approved for the treatment of adult patients with polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis. The European Commission also approved Amvuttra for treating hATTR amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 or 2 polyneuropathy. Recently, the drug has also been approved by the FDA for treating cardiomyopathy of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis ATTR-CM in adults to reduce cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations and urgent heart failure visits. A regulatory application seeking approval of Amvuttra for the ATTR-CM indication in the EU is currently under review. Onpattro patisiran is approved for the treatment of polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated hATTR amyloidosis. The injection recorded sales of 49.5 million in the reported quarter, down 29 on a reported basis. Onpattro sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51.2 million as well as our model estimate of 52.7 million. Despite the beat, shares of the company are down 3 on Thursday, likely because investors expected revenues to surpass expectations by a higher margin. Net revenues from collaborators were 99.2 million, down 16 from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a 65 million milestone payment received from Roche RHHBY in the year-ago quarter. Alnylam also recognizes revenues under its ongoing collaborations with Regeneron REGN and Novartis NVS. Net product revenues were 468.5 million, up 28 year over year on a reported basis and 30 at CER, driven by strong growth in patient demand for the newly approved drug, Amvuttra vutrisiran , as well as for Givlaari givosiran and Oxlumo lumasiran . Alnylam recorded total revenues of 594.2 million in the quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 588.2 million. In the year-ago quarter, total revenues were 494.3 million. The top line rose 20 year over year on a reported basis and 22 at a constant exchange rate CER , mainly driven by increased product sales. See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals ALNY reported first-quarter 2025 adjusted loss of 1 cent per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 56 cents. The company had incurred a loss of 16 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted figure excluded items like stock-based compensation expenses and unrealized loss on marketable equity securities. Story Continues Givlaari, approved for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria, recorded sales of 67 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 15 on a reported basis. Givlaari sales marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67.5 million and our model estimate of 68.7 million. Oxlumo recorded global net product revenues of 42.1 million in the reported quarter, which was relatively flat year over year on a reported basis. However, Oxlumo sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44.7 million as well as our estimate of 43.7 million. Year to date, ALNY stock has gained 8.4 against the industry s 1.8 decline.

Let s take a look at how therapeutics stocks fared in Q1, starting with Vertex Pharmaceuticals NASDAQ:VRTX . Over the next few years, therapeutic companies, which develop a wide variety of treatments for diseases and disorders, face strong tailwinds from advancements in precision medicine including the use of AI to improve hit rates and growing demand for treatments targeting rare diseases. However, headwinds such as rising scrutiny over drug pricing, regulatory unknowns, and competition from larger, more resourced pharmaceutical companies could weigh on growth.

    "text": "Lowe's (LOW) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this home improvement retailer have returned +5.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +10.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry, which Lowe's falls in, has gained 1.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

(Read More: Disney Q2 Earnings Surpass Estimates, Revenues Increase Y/Y)\n\n\n\nWith shares trading below their historical premium despite the company's improved financial outlook, Disney stock appears increasingly attractive for investors looking for both growth and stability.\n\nImpressive Financial Performance Shows Strategic Execution\n\nDisney reported outstanding financial results for its second quarter ended March 29, 2025, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) up 20% to $1.45 compared with $1.21 in the prior-year quarter. Total segment operating income increased 15% to $4.4 billion from $3.8 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, while revenues growing 7% to $23.6 billion.\n\n\n\nThese results reflect Disney's successful execution across its four strategic priorities: producing exceptional creative content, achieving profitability in streaming, evolving ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform, and driving long-term growth in its Experiences segment.\n\n\n\nThe Entertainment segment was particularly strong, with operating income surging 61% to $1.3 billion compared to the prior-year quarter. This impressive growth was largely driven by the Direct-to-Consumer business, which has finally turned the corner on profitability, a critical milestone that investors have been eagerly awaiting.\n\n\n\nDirect-to-Consumer operating income increased $289 million to $336 million, with Disney+ and Hulu reaching a combined 180.7 million subscriptions. Disney+ alone now boasts 126 million subscribers, demonstrating the platform's continued appeal in an increasingly competitive streaming landscape.\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate projects fiscal 2025 revenues of $94.88 billion, indicating 3.86% year-over-year growth, with earnings expected to increase 13.28% to $5.63 per share.

The significant profitability improvements in streaming should boost investor confidence in management's long-term strategy.\n\n\n\nDisney's creative studios continue to deliver best-in-class films and series that successfully leverage across businesses and numerous consumer touchpoints. Mufasa: The Lion King has demonstrated impressive staying power, earning more than $720 million at the global box office, while Thunderbolts from Marvel Studios opened as the number one movie worldwide.\n\n\n\nThe company has many highly anticipated titles coming to theaters later this year, including the live-action Lilo & Stitch, Elio, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Freakier Friday, Zootopia 2 and Avatar: Fire and Ash. These releases should drive not only box office revenues but also streaming engagement and merchandise sales.\n\n\n\nDisney's theatrical releases create valuable franchises and generate long-term value across the company. The Moana franchise exemplifies this strategy, with Moana 2 becoming one of the top three films of 2024 with more than $1 billion at the global box office while also driving Disney+ engagement.\n\n\n\nShares of the company have lost 0.8% in the year-to-date period against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector\u2019s growth of 0.2%. Disney+ faces intensifying competition from incumbents like Netflix NFLX, Amazon AMZN-owned Amazon Prime Video and Apple AAPL-owned Apple TV+.

    "text": "00:00 Speaker A\n\nCourtney, is it your understanding that President Trump, does he have the authority, Courtney, to do what he is proposing, what he wants to do here without congressional approval and legislation?\n\n00:18 Courtney\n\nGreat question. So, I think what was interesting in this executive order, where there is kind of a there is a request part of the order, and then there is a kind of threat part of the order. And in the request part is the suggestion that the government administration will pull together proposed MFN prices, propose these to companies, and then the companies get to choose to take actions to start lowering their US prices to come into line with those MFN prices. That perhaps is is kind of within the bounds of uh of some of the actions that could be taken if the industry decides to play ball. The second part, though, the threat if the industry doesn't play ball, is when legislation is required, kind of akin to what we saw with Biden and kind of the IRA, and the uh the MFP, the maximum fair price negotiations that are in place now for uh Medicare drugs. Um this is likely to require to be required to be instigated in legislation. Um and certainly through the press conference today, we saw reference to the fact that the intention is to load this legislation into the big beautiful bill that the Republicans are preparing on a number of topics and including tax cuts, um and ensure that that is a a a place for it to potentially pass. I think, however, there is a lot of of steps, a lot of detail, and the devil will really be in the in that detail as to whether this legislation can uh kind of proceed, doesn't have court issues going for going forward, and uh and we do actually see any implementation of this. I think is is still a question mark.\n\n04:26 Speaker A\n\nSo, Courtney, do you think that the drug companies will call the president's bluff and not lower the prices as he's requesting?\n\n04:47 Courtney\n\nI think this is something that we're going to see playing out over the over the next few weeks to months. Uh they've given themselves uh the administration a 30-day deadline to to begin these conversations with pharma companies. Um bearing in mind, kind of the the the pharma lobbying body, Pharma, and uh many of the CEOs have been engaged with the administration kind of day in and day out over the past couple of months on this along with tariffs. So, kind of this will be a continuation of conversations that have probably already been happening in private. Um certainly what we did see in the executive order were a number of things that the drug companies have been wanting to achieve. They've been wanting to uh point the target to the countries outside the US and say, \"Their drug prices are too low, uh and we need your help there.\" And they've also been pointing to the PBMs as being responsible for a large part of the reason as to why US drug prices are too high. So, there certainly were some olive branches given to the industry, um and definitely a reflection even of the industry lobbying lex lobbying language in this bill, sorry, in this executive order. Um and so when it comes to kind of is there going to be goodwill and trust from the industry, there might be a path here, but we'll just have to wait and see.",

    "cleaned_text": "Investing.com -- HSBC has downgraded Chevron NYSE:CVX from Buy to Hold, citing reduced valuation upside and a cut to shareholder distributions. The downgrade comes amid a broader reset across the oil majors, triggered by a fall in Brent prices to the low 60s per barrel, pressuring financial frameworks previously anchored around 70 b. We downgrade Chevron from Buy to Hold on lower shareholder distributions after the company cut buybacks with 1Q results, HSBC analysts led by Kim Fustier wrote. Chevron s second-quarter buyback was reduced to 2.5 3 billion, a marked drop from the 4 4.75 billion pace seen previously. This implies a full-year rate of 10 12 billion, well below the earlier 17.5 billion run-rate. The bank also cut its target price on Chevron to 158 from 176, now implying 15 upside from the current share price. Analysts added that Chevron now trades at a 12 13 discount to ExxonMobil NYSE:XOM on 2025 26 estimated price-to-cash flow, which adequately reflects greater risks. Operationally, Chevron delivered a solid first quarter, with upstream production slightly beating consensus. However, cash flow fell short, missing expectations by 6 . The company has not altered its 15 billion capex plan for the year but retains flexibility given two-thirds of its capital expenditures are tied to short-cycle shale or near-term projects. HSBC s earnings per share EPS forecasts for Chevron were slashed by 18 for 2025 through 2027, while cash flow per share estimates dropped 4 9 over the same period. These revisions reflect updated oil and gas price assumptions, which now see Brent at 68.5 b in 2025, down from a prior forecast of 73 b. Among peers, HSBC maintains Buy ratings on Shell LON:SHEL , TotalEnergies EPA:TTEF , Eni SpA BIT:ENI , Equinor ASA OL:EQNR , and Galp Energia Nom ELI:GALP , citing stronger balance sheets or more resilient distribution capacity.

The stocks recovered well from their pre-market decline on Monday in response to President Trump\u2019s social media post, which stated that the government will sign an executive order later in the day that will result in a 30% to 80% decrease in prescription drug prices in the United States.\n\nHowever, the post did not specify whether the order would apply to Medicare, Medicaid or other government health programmes.\n\nWhat the Executive Order Says\n\nThe President feels that the cost of prescription drugs in the United States is higher than in any other country, sometimes even five to ten times higher. Trump issued the executive order around midday on Monday. The executive order pushes for \u201cmost-favored-nation pricing,\u201d meaning Americans should pay no more than the lowest price offered to other developed countries for prescription drugs. The order aims to push drugmakers to offer prescription drugs to U.S. cash-pay consumers at lower prices.\n\nThe order mentioned that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will create programs to let Americans buy drugs directly from pharmaceutical companies at the most-favored-nation lowest price. The HHS was instructed to notify drug manufacturers of new price targets within 30 days.\n\nThe order also mentioned that The Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative must act against foreign countries that unfairly suppress drug prices. The order also mentioned that if prices do not come down quickly, a rule will be proposed to enforce these prices.\n\nThe Order Not as Bad as Feared for Drugmakers?\n\nIt looks like the executive order aims to push Americans away from Medicare, Medicaid or other government health programmes and pharmacy-benefit managers to cash-pay options. The details of the order are limited and it seems that more work needs to be done. The immediate impact of the order was not clear and questions have been raised about the legality of the pricing negotiations. Probably as the order was not as hard-hitting as feared, drug stocks recovered from the pre-market decline. The broader market rally amid easing of trade tensions between the United States and China also contributed to drug stocks\u2019 rise.\n\nTrump tried to implement a similar rule at the end of his last term in 2020. However, it was squashed by federal courts for procedural reasons. The latest executive order will also likely be challenged in court.",

    "finetuned_summary": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NasdaqGS:REGN) recently reported earnings for Q1 2025 with a revenue drop to 3,029 million compared to the prior year, though net income increased, reflecting robust profitability with diluted earnings per share rising to 7.27. The company declared a dividend and executed a significant share repurchase. Despite these positive financial maneuvers, the stock dropped by 8.5 over the last month. Factors like the FDA's complete response letter for EYLEA HD and the broader market's flat performance may have added weight to this decline while the market climbed 8 over the past year."

    "text": "Walmart\u2019s growing e-commerce isn\u2019t just a means to attract higher-income households, but also opens up avenues for other higher-margin revenue streams like advertising and third-party fulfillment. The e-commerce business in the U.S. is now profitable, and management sees it as a significant earnings contributor for the year. E-commerce accounts for an estimated 15% of total ex-gasoline sales at present, which management sees eventually increasing to more than double that level over time.\n\nManagement indicated their commitment to maintain price advantage over rivals, a function of Walmart\u2019s size, the nature of its supplier relationships, and the increasing automation of its logistical operations. Walmart\u2019s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.\n\nManagement noted that roughly two-thirds of U.S. sales are from domestically-sourced products, which gives them a degree of insulation from the tariffs issue compared to others. A big part of this is Walmart\u2019s groceries business, which accounts for almost 60% of its sales, unlike Target, where groceries are a much smaller part of the revenue mix.\n\nWhile they acknowledged some near-term challenges as a result of the uncertain macro environment, they remain confident of achieving long-term plans and targets, including sales growth of at least +4% and operating income growth above the sales growth pace. Walmart has been coming ahead of its target over the last two years, with sales up +5.5% and operating income up +9.5%.\n\nThe Walmart report will set the tone for the rest of the retail space, as it will not only give us a good sense of the impact of the new tariff regime and broader consumer spending trends. Management touched on some of these trends in its April 9th investor day event, noting some near-term tariff-related challenges.\n\nWalmart will kick off the Q1 reporting cycle for the \u2018conventional\u2019 retailers this week, with the rest of the group coming out from the following week onwards.\n\nWith the company set to report quarterly results on Thursday, May 15th, it will be interesting to see if the stock can maintain its performance momentum after the results. Walmart shares were down following the last quarterly release on February 20 th , which followed four back-to-back quarterly reports that had generally been received favorably. Target is scheduled to report results on May 21 st .\n\nWalmart shares have been standout performers this year, handily outperforming not just the broader market indexes and peers like Target but also the likes of Amazon and most of the Magnificent 7 group members.\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 May 12, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT and Amazon AMZN.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWalmart is expected to report $0.58 in EPS on $165.6 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of -3.3% and +2.5%, respectively. While the EPS estimate aligns with management\u2019s original guidance of 57 to 58 cents per share, we should note that it was not reaffirmed at the April 9th event, and estimates have modestly come down since the quarter got underway.\n\nManagement had noted a less favorable business mix for the quarter, with the general merchandise business getting off to a weak start, but trends improving later in the quarter. A positive general merchandise read will also have positive read-throughs for Target. Same-store sales (ex-fuel) are expected to be up +3.21% for the quarter, compared to +4.9% in the preceding period (vs. expectations of +4.36%).\n\nConcerning the Retail sector 2025 Q1 earnings season scorecard , we now have results from 20 of the 33 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification.\n\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers, online vendors like Amazon, and restaurant players. The 20 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already belong primarily to the e-commerce and restaurant industries, though we have several restaurant companies on deck to report results this week as well.\n\nTotal Q1 earnings for these 20 retailers that have reported are up +20.2% from the same period last year on +6.9% higher revenues, with 55% beating EPS estimates and only 45% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe EPS and revenue beats percentages for these online players and restaurant operators are tracking significantly below the historical averages for this group of companies.\n\nWith respect to the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 20 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q1 earnings were up +42.6% on +8.6% higher revenues, beating EPS and top-line expectations.\n\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart is a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart\u2019s upcoming results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a massive boost from the COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nEarnings for the group outside of Amazon are down -6.3% on a +5.4% top-line gain, which points to margin pressures for the group.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nWe have over 500 companies on deck to report results this week, including 11 S&P 500 members. In addition to Walmart, the bellwethers reporting this week include Cisco Systems, Applied Materials, Deere & Company, and China\u2019s Alibaba.\n\nThe Q1 Earnings Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, May 9th, we have seen Q1 results from 452 S&P 500 members or 90.4% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these 452 index members are up +12.2% from the same period last year on +4.4% revenue gains, with 73.7% of the companies beating EPS estimates and 61.9% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below historical averages, with the Q1 EPS beats percentage of 73.7% for the companies that have reported already comparing to the average for the same group of 78% over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years). The Q1 revenue beats percentage of 61.9% compares to the 5-year average for this group of index members of 70.5%.\n\nIs the Turnaround in Estimates for Real?\n\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 452 S&P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, the expectation is that earnings will be up +12.3% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, which would follow the +14.1% earnings growth on +5.7% revenue gains in the preceding period.\n\nWe noted in recent weeks that estimates for the current period (2025 Q2) have been coming down, with the negative revisions trend expected to accelerate further as companies report results and talk up the extent of uncertainty around their near-term business outlook.\n\nThe magnitude of cuts to 2025 Q2 estimates since the start of the period is bigger and more widespread relative to what we have become used to seeing in the post-COVID period. But we are starting to notice a curious development with the Tech sector estimate, both for Q2 as well as full-year 2025.\n\nWe see this same trend at play in annual estimates as well.\n\nAs favorable as this development on the revisions front is, we are hesitant to claim that the process of downward adjustments to estimates has run its course. After all, it is possible that analysts had ended up cutting estimates more than what was needed after the April 2nd tariff announcements.\n\nThe subsequent management commentary on the Q1 earnings calls may have made analysts realize this reality, and this modest uptick in estimates is a result of that realization. That said, if the trend continues for a few more weeks, it will be hard to interpret this development any other way than a clear sign that the earnings picture has clearly stabilized and started to strengthen.\n\nEstimates for full-year 2025 have also come under pressure in recent weeks, with the negative revisions trend becoming very meaningful and widespread since mid-February 2025. But the upward revisions to Tech sector estimates is starting to show up in full-year estimates, causing a reversal in the negative revisions trend, as the chart below shows\n\nFor more details about the evolving earnings picture, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>>Tech Earnings Estimates Increase Again: What\u2019s Going on?\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year.

    "cleaned_text": "Walmart s growing e-commerce isn t just a means to attract higher-income households, but also opens up avenues for other higher-margin revenue streams like advertising and third-party fulfillment. The e-commerce business in the U.S. is now profitable, and management sees it as a significant earnings contributor for the year. E-commerce accounts for an estimated 15 of total ex-gasoline sales at present, which management sees eventually increasing to more than double that level over time. Management indicated their commitment to maintain price advantage over rivals, a function of Walmart s size, the nature of its supplier relationships, and the increasing automation of its logistical operations. Walmart s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households. Management noted that roughly two-thirds of U.S. sales are from domestically-sourced products, which gives them a degree of insulation from the tariffs issue compared to others. A big part of this is Walmart s groceries business, which accounts for almost 60 of its sales, unlike Target, where groceries are a much smaller part of the revenue mix. While they acknowledged some near-term challenges as a result of the uncertain macro environment, they remain confident of achieving long-term plans and targets, including sales growth of at least 4 and operating income growth above the sales growth pace.

The EPS and revenue beats percentages for these online players and restaurant operators are tracking significantly below the historical averages for this group of companies. With respect to the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 20 companies that have already reported. As we know, Amazon s Q1 earnings were up 42.6 on 8.6 higher revenues, beating EPS and top-line expectations. As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now.

Key Earnings Reports This Week We have over 500 companies on deck to report results this week, including 11 S P 500 members. In addition to Walmart, the bellwethers reporting this week include Cisco Systems, Applied Materials, Deere Company, and China s Alibaba. The Q1 Earnings Scorecard Through Friday, May 9th, we have seen Q1 results from 452 S P 500 members or 90.4 of the index s total membership. Total earnings for these 452 index members are up 12.2 from the same period last year on 4.4 revenue gains, with 73.7 of the companies beating EPS estimates and 61.9 beating revenue estimates. The EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking below historical averages, with the Q1 EPS beats percentage of 73.7 for the companies that have reported already comparing to the average for the same group of 78 over the preceding 20-quarter period 5 years . The Q1 revenue beats percentage of 61.9 compares to the 5-year average for this group of index members of 70.5 . Is the Turnaround in Estimates for Real? Looking at Q1 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 452 S P 500 members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, the expectation is that earnings will be up 12.3 from the same period last year on 4.5 higher revenues, which would follow the 14.1 earnings growth on 5.7 revenue gains in the preceding period. We noted in recent weeks that estimates for the current period 2025 Q2 have been coming down, with the negative revisions trend expected to accelerate further as companies report results and talk up the extent of uncertainty around their near-term business outlook. The magnitude of cuts to 2025 Q2 estimates since the start of the period is bigger and more widespread relative to what we have become used to seeing in the post-COVID period.

    "text": "00:00 Speaker A\n\nNow time for some of today's trending tickers. We're watching Pinterest, Expedia and Taiwan Semiconductor. First up, Pinterest soaring after reporting strong first quarter revenue and issuing better than expected guidance. The social media company's second quarter revenue forecast easing concerns of an advertising slowdown. Executives say the company's ability to leverage AI, artificial intelligence, is a key differentiator there. The shares, uh, they are moving higher by about 10%. We're seeing moving, uh, higher just after the report by 15%. And ultimately here, as we continue to think about what this means for the advertising market and where Pinterest plays a role in that, I think they're carving out quite a good space and leveraging some of the artificial intelligence features that they've been talking about for a few quarters to really bring on more of those ad dollars as well.\n\n01:09 Speaker B\n\nYeah, the company being able to swing to a profit here and guiding for higher than expected revenue going forward, but there is a question mark here, of course, due to none other than potential trade-driven policies, specifically given potential headwinds in Asia, large portion of their advertising coming from Asia. They could be pulling back on spending according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst talking about his reaction to the print, having said that the monthly active users, the revenue and the EBITDA all coming in better than expected. Uh, and this is also one of my favorite, um, I like to call them girly pop stocks. We take a look at what the girlies are spending time on, and then you tend to see the stock going into a positive reaction. So that's just my personal favorite indicator. What are the Gen Z girlies using? They're using Pinterest.\n\n02:23 Speaker A\n\nI mean, that's exactly what they said. The CEO Bill Ready had essentially said that Pinterest appeal among younger demographics. Pinterest is where Gen Z goes to shop. That's what they said.\n\n02:38 Speaker B\n\nRight. Exactly, exactly. There you go. All right, let's get over to Expedia. Another look at the consumer cutting its full-year outlook as US travel demand falls. The online travel agency's first quarter results and second quarter outlook also missing estimates. The CEO warning that weaker than expected demand is continuing in their current quarter. Really tough in terms of demand in the US. They say was softer than expected and two-thirds of the company's business comes from the US.\n\n03:07 Speaker A\n\nYeah, taking a look through some of the outlook, the guidance that the company had offered, the shares are down by more than 10%. The company looking to see gross bookings between 2% and 4% here in the second quarter of 2025. Revenue growth, that's expected to be in this range of 3 to 5%. And there is a lot of caution, it seems, among analysts, but still, uh, you've got this range of price targets top side, $290 still remains, it seems. And then the downside there, $143. So, it is quite that range that you're seeing, at least from this point where Expedia is currently trading at $151 and of course, uh, as we get into trade, we'll see exactly where things continue to shift towards the CEO saying that they did deliver results within their guidance range this quarter amidst softer US travel demand. So having to acknowledge what some of the macro trends are that are playing out as well.\n\n04:21 Speaker B\n\nAbsolutely. Also, Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue jumping 48% in April as customers rushed to buy chips before tariffs took effect. Still, the recent surge of the Taiwan dollar could pressure the chip maker's margins going forward since most of its business is done in US dollars. Just taking a look at shares, they are up by about two and a half percent. This really speaks to some of the onshoring of those chip products prior to and looking to beat some of the kind of tariff implications that everyone was trying to wrap their minds and their business operations around.\n\n05:04 Speaker A\n\nYeah, and given the strong demand that you mentioned, leading to that 48% revenue jump here, obviously, that is potentially a boon for the likes of Nvidia. We are keenly awaiting their earnings print coming up here on May 28th. Taking a look at TSMC shares up over 20% for the month.

    "summary": "The current volatile situation shouldn't preclude investors from buying stocks.  Eli Lilly, Vertex, Meta Platforms, and Netflix all stand to enjoy solid growth.  Market volatility and near-term uncertainty can be challenging to deal with these days -- or at any time.",
    "text": "Vertex continues to make progress. In December, it earned approval for Alyftrek, a next-gen CF therapy with a convenient once-daily dosing -- its current standard of care, Trikafta, needs to be taken twice a day. There's a good chance another company will eventually make a breakthrough in CF; if it happens, Vertex will be ready, having significantly diversified its lineup in recent years. In January, Journavx, a medicine for acute pain, got the nod from regulators.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals has what might be the most powerful moat in the world -- it holds a monopoly in the market for drugs that treat a rare lung disease called cystic fibrosis (CF). This dominance grants the biotech significant pricing power. Although many other drugmakers have tried to enter this field and challenge Vertex, none has been successful yet .\n\nEli Lilly is an excellent stock for growth- and income-oriented investors. The company's shares took a post-earnings dip due to weak guidance, but for investors willing to hold on to its shares for a while, that offers a buying opportunity.\n\nAnd amid the strong financial results it consistently delivers, Lilly keeps increasing its dividend: It has more than doubled its payouts in the past five years.\n\nBut besides work in its core areas, Lilly is also making strides elsewhere. Newer approvals like Ebglyss for eczema look promising. The company's work in oncology is showing good progress. Older medicines, such as cancer medicine Verzenio and immunosuppressant Taltz, continue to help drive top-line growth.\n\nLilly is still flexing its innovative muscles. It recently reported positive phase 3 results for an oral GLP-1 therapy, orforglipron, that would be yet another breakthrough.\n\nEli Lilly is a leading pharmaceutical company that has garnered a lot of headlines in recent years. The company's work in diabetes and weight management is the main reason why; its famous brands like Mounjaro and Zepbound are growing their sales at an almost dizzying pace.\n\nLet's consider four outstanding companies that are worth investing in and holding on to for a long time: Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX).\n\nMarket volatility and near-term uncertainty can be challenging to deal with these days -- or at any time. However, even in the current environment, there are excellent investment opportunities. Those who go shopping for great stocks right now and hold on to them for a while should see excellent returns over long periods of, say, a decade or more, despite the near-term headwinds.\n\nThe four companies below look like excellent options to consider now.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt also markets Casgevy, a gene-editing therapy for two rare blood diseases, which received approval in late 2023. These will help drive strong top-line growth.\n\nLastly, Vertex's pipeline looks exciting. The company's strategy is to develop therapies where there are unmet needs, and it has several programs along those lines across all stages of clinical trials. Vertex should see plenty of clinical and regulatory progress over the next five years, while maintaining solid financial results.\n\nThe stock did take a post-earnings dip because of disappointing results, but it still looks likely to deliver superior returns to patient investors.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms recently delivered excellent first-quarter financial results. Though we should never make long-term investment decisions based on a single (albeit solid) quarter, Meta's results continued a series of robust performances, showing once again why it's such an attractive stock. The company has an ecosystem of 3.43 billion daily active users across its websites and apps, making it one of advertisers' favorite targets.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) initiatives are helping drive user growth and engagement, leading to stronger ad-related revenue. And the company is doubling down. Management announced significant AI investments, and given the results they've helped achieve, Meta seems justified in going that route. AI and advertising will be considerable long-term growth avenues for the company, especially considering that Meta Platforms won't lose its lead in the social media sphere thanks to its network effect.\n\nLastly, Meta Platforms will continue to ramp up other opportunities, including its metaverse projects and business messaging on WhatsApp. The stock might not maintain its momentum this year, depending on the state of the economy, but its long-term prospects remain bright.\n\n4. Netflix\n\nNetflix is the leader in streaming and has remained so despite mounting competition. Streaming platforms are popping up like weeds; some are free, some specialize in specific areas (like sports or old movies), some rely on ads, and so on. Through it all, the company has maintained its lead thanks to the strength of its brand name. \"Netflix\" is often used as a synonym for streaming, and none of its competitors has this kind of edge.\n\nThe company's large ecosystem allows it to collect data on viewer habits, and create shows and movies accordingly. It has had plenty of smashing successes and should have more. In recent years, Netflix has made important changes to its business, including introducing an ad-supported tier and cracking down on password-sharing. These changes have led to significant improvements in profitability and free cash flow.\n\nAnd the streaming specialist still sees a considerable growth runway ahead. It estimates a $650 billion revenue opportunity, of which it has just scratched the surface. Netflix has been crushing the market for the past two years, but there is plenty of upside left for investors willing to hold on to its shares for five years or longer.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

Although the auto sector was excluded from the deal, optimism still remains. Joining us now, senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian. So, what changes is it? Does anything change for the auto makers as a result of this?\n\n00:18 Pras Subramanian\n\nNothing's changed. It's all about optimism. Uh Dan Ives telling me that he, they hope that autos are next on the docket for any type of deal. Uh so currently we still have the 100% plus EV China EV tariffs are still in place right now. Uh you also have 25% parts and part and auto tariffs. So that nothing's changed but there's optimism growing that that will potentially be next for Trump and the team. But I mean, that's still a big if, right? And he hasn't mentioned anything about changing sector tariffs for autos at this moment. Uh and we hear, we heard about just this quarter how bad it could be, right? 4 to 5 billion for GM, 1.5 billion for Ford in terms of EBIT full year EBIT hits. And Toyota alone 1.3 billion in the last two months. So\n\n00:58 Speaker A\n\nWas it? Was Toyota the worst by the way? Is that?\n\n01:01 Pras Subramanian\n\nYeah, for April and May, they anticipated a 1.3 billion dollar hit to operating profits. So that's like giving us an idea of how bad it could be for them. So a a a deal with Japan could be a big deal for for the for U.S. because more likely than a deal with China for for sector autos.\n\n01:17 Speaker A\n\nAnd and just to be, so just to be clear, the 145% that was imposed the blanket tariff on China, that was not the tariff on auto parts. That was always just the 25%, correct? So it already wasn't the sort of that highest tariff that was out there.\n\n01:40 Pras Subramanian\n\nRight. They had sort of hived off all the auto stuff to its own separate sort of sector tariff exactly 100%.\n\n01:47 Speaker A\n\nAnd a company like Tesla, the cars that sells in China makes in China. Yes. Right? So it doesn't really materially affect it. It's more about vibes I guess.\n\n01:58 Pras Subramanian\n\nYeah, but also there's parts that that they there are some parts that come from China that they use that they can't replicate here. So that's part of. But you're absolutely it's more about optimism and these vibes. It's what's coming up next. I think that's sort of why everyone's bidding up the auto makers right now.",

    "text": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Home Depot (HD), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Home Furnishings industry.\n\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this home-improvement retailer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 3.40%, on average, in the last two quarters.\n\nFor the last reported quarter, Home Depot came out with earnings of $3.13 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 per share, representing a surprise of 2.96%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $3.64 per share and it actually produced earnings of $3.78 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.85%.\n\nPrice and EPS Surprise\n\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Home Depot lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\n\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\n\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\n\nHome Depot has an Earnings ESP of +0.43% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 20, 2025.\n\nWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.\n\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher.

    "summary": "MA impresses with strong Q1 results, driven by robust payment volumes and surging demand for value-added services.",
    "text": "Payments giant Mastercard Incorporated MA reported strong first-quarter 2024 results, driven by growth in gross dollar volume, cross-border transactions, and rising demand for its value-added services. However, cross-border transaction growth slowed in regions like the Middle East and Africa, impacted by reduced travel activity.\n\nDespite this, investors reacted positively. MA shares have climbed 3.5% since the earnings release, pushing the stock near its 52-week high of $582.23. This raises the question: Should investors continue buying at these levels, or is it time to hold off?\n\n4 Major Takeaways From Mastercard\u2019s Q1 Earnings\n\nEarnings & Sales Beat: Mastercard\u2019s EPS of $3.73 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.5% and grew 13% year over year. Also, the top line came in at $7.3 billion, beating estimates by 1.8% and increasing 14% from the prior year. For a detailed analysis, read our blog here. (See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.)\n\nKey Metrics Show Continued Growth: Gross dollar volume increased 9% year over year on a local-currency basis to $2.4 trillion, though it missed the Zacks estimate by 2.6%. Switched transactions rose 11%, and Mastercard reported 3.5 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued as of March 31, 2025.\n\nCross-Border Volumes: On a local-currency basis, cross-border volumes grew 15% in the first quarter of 2025, down from 19% in the year-ago quarter. A slowdown in global travel and international e-commerce may further impact this metric. Trade tensions and other macroeconomic challenges could add pressure. That said, resilient consumer spending and job growth are providing support to payment volumes. Major rival Visa Inc. V is experiencing similar dynamics, though its larger domestic footprint could mean different exposure levels.\n\nGrowing Services Business: Mastercard is aggressively investing in its services business \u2014 especially in cybersecurity and data analytics \u2014 to diversify beyond traditional payments. These services contributed 39% of total net revenues in the first quarter, with value-added services bringing in $2.8 billion, up 16.1% year over year. Growth was supported by demand for customer acquisition, engagement tools, and market intelligence.\n\nMastercard's Long-Term Growth Drivers\n\nMastercard\u2019s footprint in emerging markets, especially in Southeast Asia and Latin America, is positioning the company for sustained long-term growth. These initiatives help compensate for revenue lost from its exit from the Russian market. With millions of underbanked consumers in these regions, the company has a strong runway for expansion.",

MA shares have climbed 3.5 since the earnings release, pushing the stock near its 52-week high of 582.23. This raises the question: Should investors continue buying at these levels, or is it time to hold off? 4 Major Takeaways From Mastercard s Q1 Earnings Earnings Sales Beat: Mastercard s EPS of 3.73 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.5 and grew 13 year over year. Also, the top line came in at 7.3 billion, beating estimates by 1.8 and increasing 14 from the prior year. For a detailed analysis, read our blog here. See the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news. Key Metrics Show Continued Growth: Gross dollar volume increased 9 year over year on a local-currency basis to 2.4 trillion, though it missed the Zacks estimate by 2.6 . Switched transactions rose 11 , and Mastercard reported 3.5 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued as of March 31, 2025. Cross-Border Volumes: On a local-currency basis, cross-border volumes grew 15 in the first quarter of 2025, down from 19 in the year-ago quarter. A slowdown in global travel and international e-commerce may further impact this metric. Trade tensions and other macroeconomic challenges could add pressure. That said, resilient consumer spending and job growth are providing support to payment volumes. Major rival Visa Inc. V is experiencing similar dynamics, though its larger domestic footprint could mean different exposure levels. Growing Services Business: Mastercard is aggressively investing in its services business especially in cybersecurity and data analytics to diversify beyond traditional payments. These services contributed 39 of total net revenues in the first quarter, with value-added services bringing in 2.8 billion, up 16.1 year over year. Growth was supported by demand for customer acquisition, engagement tools, and market intelligence. Mastercard's Long-Term Growth Drivers Mastercard s footprint in emerging markets, especially in Southeast Asia and Latin America, is positioning the company for sustained long-term growth. These initiatives help compensate for revenue lost from its exit from the Russian market. With millions of underbanked consumers in these regions, the company has a strong runway for expansion.",

    "finetuned_summary": "President Trump and his team like to tout 2 trillion in new company investments made since Inauguration Day. They argue it illustrates a broad economic renaissance and shows how tariffs can be used as an incentive to attract more commitments. Nearly all of the big-dollar investments thus far have two things in common, according to a Yahoo Finance analysis of the 60-plus projects. They are clustered in the world of Big Tech and largely come from sectors where Trump's final tariff plans are most uncertain."

(LON:BP.) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. The ex-dividend date is commonly two business days before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. In other words, investors can purchase BP's shares before the 15th of May in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of June.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be US$0.08 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.32 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that BP has a trailing yield of 6.5% on the current share price of UK\u00a33.723. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends.

If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. BP reported a loss after tax last year, which means it's paying a dividend despite being unprofitable. While this might be a one-off event, this is unlikely to be sustainable in the long term. With the recent loss, it's important to check if the business generated enough cash to pay its dividend. If cash earnings don't cover the dividend, the company would have to pay dividends out of cash in the bank, or by borrowing money, neither of which is long-term sustainable.

The US growth stocks fell by 10%, and US value stocks increased by 2%. This transition demonstrates a significant market rotation throughout geography and style as value stocks continue to gain favor over growth stocks.

    "text": "Amazon has found itself involved in three recent legal developments regarding its trucking operations.\n\nIn one, it suffered a setback in Indiana in a lawsuit involving a driver who was killed near a fulfillment center. In another, prosecutors in Connecticut said the company was scammed out of $3 million.

    "finetuned_summary": "Amazon has found itself involved in three recent legal developments regarding its trucking operations. In one, it suffered a setback in Indiana in a lawsuit involving a driver who was killed near a fulfillment center. In another, prosecutors in Connecticut said the company was scammed out of 3 million. And in the third, a tractor-trailer pulling an Amazon load near Chattanooga, Tennessee, was involved in an accident that led to multiple deaths and charges against the driver. In the Indiana case, a three-judge panel at the state s Court of Appeals last week unanimously overturned a lower court decision from June 2023 that dismissed a lawsuit\u2026"

It aimed to shift that spending toward rapidly growing its clean energy businesses.\n\nHowever, a recovery in oil prices and years of underperformance led the oil giant to shift gears on its strategy again earlier this year. It's slashing spending on renewables from a plan to invest $5 billion annually to a $1.5 billion to $2 billion yearly level.\n\nMeanwhile, it's boosting its oil and gas capital investment plan to $10 billion per year. As a result, BP will grow its renewable business much more slowly while increasing its overall oil and gas output to an average of 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day by 2030, up from less than 2.4 million BOE last year.\n\nBP's abrupt strategy shifts have it searching for an identity. It stands in stark contrast to U.S. oil giants Exxon and Chevron, which have well-defined multiyear strategies for growing shareholder value. For example, Exxon plans to invest $140 billion in developing its advantaged assets (lower cost and higher margin) while stripping out billions of structural costs. This plan has the oil giant on track to add an incremental $20 billion in earnings and $30 billion in free cash flow by 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, Chevron is also investing heavily in growing its advantaged assets, which will drive industry-leading free-cash-flow growth of as much as $10 billion by 2026. Both oil companies are also investing strategically to grow their lower-carbon energy platforms, focusing on investments that can earn attractive returns, like carbon capture and storage, biofuels, and hydrogen.",

    "text": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer first-quarter 2025 earnings call. Also, joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon. As a reminder, our earnings release contains a thorough MD&A that goes through the segment results in detail, and we encourage everyone to look at the release as well as the slides posted to our website to gain a full understanding of the quarter and our growth opportunities. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, which we expect to file this Thursday, May 8. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. So let's start with our financial results today. For the first quarter of '25, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $4.1 billion compared to $3.9 billion for the first quarter of 2024. We saw strong volumes through our midstream gathering, crude gathering, natural gas interstate and NGL pipelines as well as through our NGL fractionators. In addition, we saw strong NGL exports during the quarter. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was $2.3 billion. And for the first three months of 2025, we spent approximately $955 million on organic growth capital, primarily in the interstate, midstream and NGL and refined products segments excluding Sun and USA Compression CapEx. Now turning to our results by segment for the first quarter. Let's start with NGL and refined products, adjusted EBITDA was $978 million compared to $989 million for the first quarter of 2024. This was primarily due to higher throughput across the NGL export terminals and across our Permian and Mariner East pipeline operations, which were offset by higher operating expenses and lower blending margins compared to the first quarter of 2024. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was $925 million compared to $696 million for the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher legacy volumes in the Permian Basin, which were up 8% as well as the addition of the WTG assets in July of 2024. In addition, results for the first quarter of 2025 were favorably impacted by the nonrecurring recognition of $160 million associated with Winter Storm Uri in 2021. This represents the remainder of the midstream segment margin from Winter Storm Uri that had not already been recognized. Still outstanding in the intrastate segment is approximately $285 million, excluding interest, that is currently in litigation. The vast majority of which is due from CPS. For the crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was $742 million compared to $848 million for the first quarter of 2024. During the quarter, we saw growth across our crude gathering systems as well as contributions related to the recently formed Permian joint venture with Sun. These were offset by lower transportation revenues, primarily on the Bakken pipeline, higher expenses as well as lower gains due to the timing of the recognition of optimization gains in Q1 of 2025 as compared to Q1 2024. Lower optimization gains were primarily due to lower hedge gains realized during the quarter, a write-down to hedged inventory at the end of the quarter and the timing of the recognition of gains on certain physical crude sales. We expect approximately $30 million of losses related to the hedge inventory that were realized in the first quarter of 2025 to reverse during the second quarter of 2025. In our interstate natural gas segment, adjusted EBITDA was $512 million compared to $483 million for the first quarter of 2024. During the quarter, we achieved record volumes driven by higher throughput on Panhandle, Gulf Run and Trunkline. The growth on Trunkline was related to our backhaul project to support growing Gulf Coast natural gas demand. We also had increased rates on several of our pipelines in the first quarter. For the intrastate natural gas segment, adjusted EBITDA was $344 million compared to $438 million in the first quarter of last year. During the quarter, we saw increased gains related to storage optimization opportunities, which were more than offset by reduced pipeline optimization as a result of lower volatility in natural gas prices compared to the first quarter of 2024. Now let's take a look at the organic growth capital guidance. We continue to expect approximately $5 billion on organic growth capital projects in 2025. Our projects are expected to achieve mid-teen returns with most of them also providing incremental downstream benefits. In addition, the majority of these projects are expected online in 2025 or 2026, including our Flexport NGL export expansion, several Permian processing plant expansions and our Hugh Brinson pipeline project. As such, we continue to expect the majority of the earnings growth from these projects to significantly ramp up in 2026 and 2027. Taking a closer look at some of our largest growth projects that are currently underway. During the first quarter, we commenced construction on Phase 1 of the Hugh Brinson pipeline, which we expect to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2026. A we have secured the majority of the pipeline steel, which is currently being rolled in US pipe mills, and as a result, do not expect any material impacts to cost of the project from tariff announcements. Phase 1 is completely sold out, and we are currently in negotiations that are well in excess of Phase 2 capacity. At our Nederland Terminal, construction of our Flexport expansion project is nearing completion. We expect to begin ethane service later this month and propane service in July, and we continue to expect to begin ethylene export service in the fourth quarter of this year. Looking at our Permian processing expansions, the Red Lake 4 processing plant is now expected to be in service by the end of the second quarter of 2025. The Badger processing plant remains on schedule to be in service in mid-2025 and the Mustang Draw plant is now expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2026. Now let's look at Lake Charles LNG. We are making substantial progress towards commercialization of the project. In April, Lake Charles LNG and Mid-Ocean Energy signed a heads of agreement, which provides a nonbinding framework for the joint development of the LNG project. Pursuant to the HOA, Mid-Ocean would commit to fund 30% of the construction cost and be entitled to 30% of the LNG production. Mid-Ocean is an LNG company formed and managed by EIG Global Energy Partners. In April, Lake Charles LNG signed a binding SPA with a Japanese utility company for up to 1 MTPA with the agreement subject to the approval of the Board of this company, which is expected to be received by the end of May. Also, in April, we signed an HOA with a German energy company for 1 MTPA. Lake Charles LNG is in discussions for the remaining uncommitted LNG offtake volume and is targeting FID by year-end. Now for a brief update around our power generation opportunities the level of activity from demand pull customers has remained strong. And we're in advanced discussions with several other facilities in close proximity to our footprint to supply store and transport natural gas from gas-fired power plants, data centers, and industrial and onshore manufacturing. On our last earnings call, we were excited to announce that we have entered into a long-term agreement with CloudBurst data centers to provide natural gas to their flagship AI-focused data center development in Central Texas. We would expect these types of projects to require very low capital and to generate revenue relatively quickly. There is a lot of competition around these projects, but our team has done an excellent job of identifying the most likely opportunities, and we will continue to provide updates as we move forward. Lastly, construction of 8, 10-megawatt natural gas-fired electric generation facilities continues. The first facility was placed into service in the first quarter, and we expect the next one to be in service by the end of the second quarter. With the remainder expected to be in service throughout 2025 and 2026. And now turning to our guidance. We continue to expect our 2025 adjusted EBITDA to be between $16.1 billion and $16.5 billion. We benefit from an integrated business model that is well diversified by products and geography. Our cash flows are highly fee-based with limited commodity price exposure and financially, our balance sheet is in the strongest position in our history. We also have a high percentage of take-or-pay contracts helping to reduce impacts from market volatility. We are executing on a solid backlog of well contracted growth projects with strong counterparties, which are expected to generate strong returns, enhance our integrated value chain and promote strong growth. We will start to see contributions from some of these projects this year with additional benefits really ramping up next year as we quickly convert CapEx into cash flow. Given Energy Transfer's extensive natural gas infrastructure, we are excited to see the growing demand in and around our franchise to support power plant data center and LNG growth. With our diverse integrated asset base and strong financial position, we believe we are well positioned to manage volatility while we continue to grow. Before we close, we'd like to take a moment to mention Sunoco's recently announced plans to acquire Parkland Corporation. We are excited for SUN as they work to bring these assets into the family of partnerships. This combination is expected to create the largest independent field distributor in the Americas. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line up for our first question.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Theresa Chen, Barclays.\n\nTheresa Chen\n\nI'd like to first ask on the Lake Charles progress. Looking to your year-end target FID, can you talk about additional steps from here either from a commercialization financing or permitting a regulatory perspective? And more broadly, how do you think US LNG is situated given increasing competitive dynamics domestically as well as increasing demand abroad with the EU commission proposing to phase out imports of all Russian gas and LNG.\n\nMarshall McCrea\n\nTheresa, this is Mackie. We continue to gain momentum and be excited about getting to FID. We've worked many, many years on this project. We've got teams over as we speak. In fact, even on this call moments ago, we got a text.\n\nWe signed up another 1 million tons from a large international energy company. So we're very excited. However, we've still got work to do. We now pass 10.4 million tons. We're targeting about 15 million tons.\n\nAs Tom just said on his opening statements, we have a big partner in this now. We're looking for other partners where at the end of the day, we won about 75% to 80% equity and/or infrastructure partners still have that box to check. We are finalizing our EPC cost over these next couple of months and everything is looking good. Like I said, we've got a lot of work to do, but we're very excited about where we're at, and we're also very excited about the new administration that will not hold up.\n\nIn fact, we'll promote these types of projects, not only benefit our country, our partnership, but also our friends around the world that so desperately need LNG. So we're excited about a lot of work to do and certainly hope we reach FID by the end of the year.\n\nAs far as the second question you had, kind of hard to address that, we feel pretty good where our prices are. We know there's a lot of competition out there. Some are already at FID. Some aren't. We're successful in continuing to price our capacity in a manner that works for our returns. So we kind of don't worry and think much about what others are doing. We focus on what we've got, and we're excited and are hopeful to get there by the end of the year.\n\nTheresa Chen\n\nAnd with one of your portfolio companies getting a currency soon potentially, how does that parlay into the potential for energy transfer to also have a C corp presence? What are your thoughts on that topic at this point?\n\nThomas Long\n\nTheresa, this is Tom. We've always had that on the options list, if you will. We continue to evaluate it and see what makes sense from an energy transfer standpoint. Obviously, very excited to see SUN to be able to first execute on one, and we'll evaluate that carefully. But as we sit here right now, it's really not any more plans than probably we had before this transaction as far as energy transfer goes. So it's an option, and we're going to continue to look at it, and we'll stay tuned.\n\nOperator\n\nJeremy Tonet, JPMorgan.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nI was just curious, given the volatility we have seen in commodity prices and we're starting to see some rigs being dropped even in the Permian. Just wondering, I guess, with your latest producer customer conversations, what your outlook is for production, if that has changed meaningfully? Or how do you expect it to impact the Energy Transfer?\n\nMarshall McCrea\n\nOkay. This is Mackie again. Typically, I'll make a brief statement at the end. Sometimes I'll make a brief statement real quick. And I think it's important for this question and also for other questions that might come up.\n\nWe were talking a couple of weeks ago and a lot of us have been in this business for 35, 40 years, someone like Tom, longer than that. But anyway, we've seen a lot of cycles. It's a very cyclical business. And we've seen gas at $1.50. We've seen gas at $8 or $9.\n\nWe've seen oil at less than $10. We've seen oil at $120. We've had quarters where we were panicked about what the spread is between Waha and Katy because we were a natural gas pipeline company. And fortunately, where we are today with Kelsey's leadership and guidance is we're the most diversified kind of unparalleled midstream pipeline company in the United States. And just quickly a few comments on that.\n\nIn addition to kind of our segments, we've got our USA compression run by Clint, who's doing a great job of not only maintaining what they have, but look for growth over the coming years. We got Joe Kim and his team with Sunoco. He's done an incredible job with the assets they purchased. Now they just made a huge announcement that we see a lot of upside for them. Of course, that also provides additional distributions, which don't hurt our feelings at all.\n\nAnd then you look at our segment, you look at our Crude segment, run by Adam and his team. And we move about 20% of the barrels out of West Texas, about 30% of the barrels that are produced in the United States go through our pipes, over 50% in the Bakken. We're one of the largest deliverers of barrels to the refineries around Port Arthur and then, of course, Bayou Bridge to the Lake Charles and St. James, and then on and so forth, up the Mid-Continent. Then you jump over to the NGLs and the massive pipelines we've built with Mariner and we are the company to go to with any ethane, propane growth out of the Northeast through our Marcus Hook terminal.\n\nAnd then, of course, our incredible expansion at Nederland that we're also completing our next 250,000 in our NGL world where we move a lot of barrels, over 1 million barrels a day go into that. Very excited about that. And of course, midstream. We've got a big presence in the Permian and a lot of other places. And then you look at what's going on in the pipeline -- our intrastate, our interstate and how well we've built all those out from all the major basins, delivering to all the major markets, whether it's LNG or whether it's power plants or the utilities or cities or whatever, we just have positioned ourselves in such a good way to where if one segment slows down or whatever, the other one picks it back up.\n\nSo all that saying, going to your question, yes, we are seeing a slowdown a little bit over the last few weeks. We actually have been in conversations, Tom and I have, with some of the majors. They really haven't indicated at these kind of $50 barrel of pricing that necessarily going to slow down. But we have seen even in the last day, yesterday and today, there's been some statements on slowdown. We're well positioned to manage that.\n\nThis is what happens in this industry. It will slow down and then it will come back as a barn burner. We certainly anticipate that happening with oil but even tenfold on gas. Any kind of slowdown on gas, if you look over the next 3 or 4 years, 5 to 7 Bcf of growth in the LNG market, who knows where the AI data center and power plants are going to go on a high side or even a medium side on that. I mean, it's just a wonderful outlook for our pipeline business, both intra and interstate.\n\nSo yes, there's areas where drilling has slowed down. It will slow down some parts of that. But as a whole, we think some of the other areas of our well-balanced partnership will kind of even things out and we just stay very positive and bullish on the future, especially around NGLs and natural gas transportation.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nGot you. Makes sense. Yes, I know it's certainly important to have a diversified platform there. It seems like a slowdown in oil could help the gas supply demand dynamics and could help you out there as well. And maybe just building a gas a bit more, I guess, the opportunity set as you see it to service growing power demand in data centers even and thinking particularly to the west of Texas, just wondering how you see, I guess, the opportunity set to feed more power in Texas or data centers and also further West in Arizona as well.\n\nMarshall McCrea\n\nYes. I'll tell you, this is one of those areas where we feel like we're sitting on a gold mine. As I just mentioned, we built a lot of assets, bought a lot of pipeline assets, moving molecules from production basins to markets. We wake up here over the last 6 to 12 months and find ourselves in an incredible position. Adam and his team are -- you got a really good team he's put together to chase deals all over Texas.\n\nThere's 150 approximate data centers that we're looking at just in Texas alone, we would love to elaborate and talk about some significant progress we make. We do believe in the next four to six weeks, we'll be able to make some significant announcements. But what's really cool about our assets, and we've said this before, is that if we were going to go out and develop.\n\nAnd we're kind of doing this to a certain degree to help some of the hyperscalers and try to place some of these data centers. We place them almost right on top of our pipes. In fact, like we said last time, CloudBurst location, our pipeline actually runs through that acreage.\n\nBut we're so well positioned from an electrical transmission standpoint, a lot of the major electric lines running through Texas parallel or very close to our pipelines. A lot of the low latency fiber optics runs in the same quarter as our pipeline. So we're very optimistic. We'd love to elaborate.\n\nYes, even outside of Texas, we see Arizona as a very significant growth area for data centers, really growth area for natural gas demand in addition to data centers elsewhere in other states call from other states, we expect to make some significant announcements over the next four to eight weeks.\n\nSo a little premature, but very excited about where that's going to take us and couldn't be couldn't feel better about our situation on where our pipeline sit. Our ability to move large volumes through these large diameter systems in the storage, we have to back up that. We just couldn't be more excited about these opportunities we're chasing.\n\nJeremy Tonet\n\nGot it. We'll be listening in the coming weeks for that announcement.\n\nOperator\n\nJean Ann Salisbury, Bank of America.\n\nJean Ann Salisbury\n\nThank you for the update on the timing of the ethane and propane in service for the Nederland Flexport expansion that starts in the next few months. Can you speak to how you're viewing the speed of the ramp for that project? And if you expect it to mainly be shipping propane or ethane in the medium term?\n\nMarshall McCrea\n\nYes, this is Mackie again. I believe we're coming on the end of this month, early next month with ethane. Regardless of what everybody is hearing about all the negativity around what's going on in China and other areas, we're not having a problem finding a home for our product or ethane or LPG. In fact, we did a deal this morning for another ethane spot cargo to China. So with those tariffs apparently being [method] around ethane and possibly LPG, we feel very good about it.\n\nJuly or August, we'll be ramping up the propane portion of that. And then by the end of this year, ethylene. All of that, we expect on a spot basis and/or some of it's turned up to stay very full for the second half of this year. And then we're on this new flexible expansion, we're over 90% sold out under 3- to 5-year agreement starting January 1 of '26. So we're very excited about that. It needs to come online for the international demand around the world. And we're excited to finally for all that hundreds of millions of dollars were spent, we're excited about the revenue that we're about to bring in the door.\n\nJean Ann Salisbury\n\nGreat. That's super helpful. And then you kind of touched on this, but my follow-up was just real time what you're seeing in the LPG export market. Is there basically enough ring rerouting, I guess, going on to avoid the China tariff on US LPG. And how do you think that plays out in the next few months?\n\nMarshall McCrea\n\nYes. With all these questions, a lot of uncertainty about what's going on in the industry. We have very little concern, even talking to our team today, as I just said, there's a lot of international demand, not just China, all over the world for ethane, propane and butane, and we really don't expect to see any major challenges if any challenges at all selling out our terminal every month, the rest of this year.\n\nOperator\n\nSpiro Dounis, Citi.\n\nSpiro Dounis\n\nMaybe just to go to Hugh Brinson, Tom, you pointed out that negotiations now are well in excess of that Phase 2 capacity. So multipart question here. One, what does that mean for the timing of Phase 2? Is there an ability to accelerate that now? And does this actually create some bottlenecks, maybe even downstream of Hugh Brinson where that could precipitate more expansions? And then lastly, what kind of customers are you dealing with here? Is this largely data center-driven demand?\n\nMarshall McCrea\n\nYes. This is Mackie again, Spiro. I tell you, it's funny we've been trying to get a 42-inch across Texas FID for, I don't even know, 4 or 5 years, and we finally got that done, and it couldn't have been better timing, especially larger last question was related data centers. However, getting that to FID had nothing to do with data centers, not one data center supported that project to get it off the ground. As we've said, we have sold out now Phase 1.\n\nWe are in negotiations with -- I wouldn't say twice as much, but significantly more volume request and we have capacity available to take it from 1.5 Bcf to 2.2 Bcf. But as I was just alluding to what an incredible time to announce a new 42-inch, 2.2 Bcf pipeline out of the most prolific basin in the United States that connects to multiple 42- and 36-inch pipes of ours that feeds markets throughout the state of Texas and then also, of course, accesses Carthage and [tax owed] to feed the Southeast, LNG, everything else. So we're very excited about that. And then as far as data centers, we call it kind of the gold rush. It's something where not only is it -- are we working with customers that we will end up probably utilizing some of the remainder capacity we have available.\n\nWe also have customers that want diversification of receipt points, meaning they may want some from Waha, some from Katy, some from Carthage. We're able to accommodate that with this massive system we've built. So we're in such a good situation very excited about. As I keep saying, we can't express our excitement enough and one kind of exclamation point on this.\n\nTying in all these, it's not just data centers. That's one thing that we probably need to elaborate on. We're negotiating with as many power plants unassociated with data centers that we think are more likely to happen just because of the need, especially here in Texas to meet the growing demand from population, et cetera.\n\nSo kind of the exclamation point is there's not a lot of capital to this. As I mentioned earlier, a lot of these areas where these data centers are proposed are right on top of us. So we're talking about moving 250,000, 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 in different directions with some good healthy margins and yet we're laying a mile of -- 5 miles of pipe. So it's exciting enough time. I'll say it again, we're thrilled with this new opportunity for our pipeline assets and very excited where that's going to take revenues for those assets in the future.\n\nSpiro Dounis\n\nIt's great to hear, Mackie. Second question, maybe this one for you as well. And I kind of want to go back to Jeremy's original question. Ask it a different way and hopefully not make you repeat yourself. Your point is well taken.\n\nI think over longer-term periods, you've proven to be pretty durable and resilient duty cycles. I guess we narrow the focus a little bit. Obviously, a lot of projects coming online this year, $5 billion of CapEx in the hopper here. And I think last time we caught up, it did suggest you'd be sort of at the higher end of your sort of 3% to 5% growth rate this year and maybe next year. And so I guess I'm curious, given everything we've seen, I realize a lot of uncertainty still, crude in the 50s. There's still feel like that $5 billion of CapEx is got enough hardwired growth inside of it to still drive 5% growth or maybe some of that come off a bit.\n\nMarshall McCrea\n\nThat's a good question. And certainly, we're always looking at everything. Every impact we might have on our system with some of the statements that have come out even recently, one thing we were joking about before this call is every time we bring on a plant, we just brought on Lenora 1 here not too long ago within days. Certainly within weeks, it's full. And so when we bring on Lenora 2 here in the next 30, 45 days, we don't know how full it's going to be. Our expectations are, it's going to fill up pretty fast.\n\nBut we do have the luxury of kind of watching what happens over the next quarter, maybe 1.5 quarters, 2 quarters. And if we really do see a slowdown, we will have the ability to defer some of these costs. We can delay Mustang draw, certainly not talk about -- think about that or anything right now on that. but it's certainly a tool and something that we can look at as well as other projects that we have. If we see a huge downturn and it's extended for some period of time, we will be able to push some of that $5 billion into $26 billion.\n\nBut way premature to any kind of that type of -- I wouldn't say panic, but any of that type of moves. We remain bullish Yes, we see some softening. Yes, we see some potential challenges over the next quarter or two. But a year, 2 years through 10 years, we're extremely bullish on our industry and on the need for all the products that we transport. And we'll just see how the next quarter plays out before we make some of those decisions.\n\nOperator\n\nKeith Stanley, Wolfe Research.\n\nKeith Stanley\n\nTwo follow-ups on that. So on the CapEx conversation, Tom, is there a figure that you have just roughly, if we're talking $5 billion of growth CapEx this year. What would that look like based on just sanctioned projects right now for 2026? Does that number come down a lot? Or how are you looking at that and flexibility for '26 spend?\n\nThomas Long\n\nYes, Keith. That's actually a very good question. Of course, we generally don't give our guidance for the current year until the end of the year. But when you really look out and you probably look at a lot of these projects that we're talking about coming on right now, we don't have that same size number currently filled up. But we do have, as always, a big backlog of projects to look at.\n\nSo I don't really have an answer for you on how to guide. But probably take it to less than half of that is probably where I would take it with you, Keith. So let's see how the year continues to develop. But as we sit here right now, that's probably a good marker without it being guidance, though.\n\nKeith Stanley\n\nOkay. So less than half of the $5 billion is sanctioned today, and obviously, that can change over time.\n\nThomas Long\n\nThat's (inaudible)\n\nKeith Stanley\n\nOkay. That's very helpful. The second follow-up, I just wanted to check on the contracting position just across NGL exports. And so I think, Mackie, you said you expect to fully sell out on a spot basis, all of your available export capacity. We also said Flexport is 90% contracted for 3 to 5 years. Just looking holistically at your NGL export portfolio, is there a percentage of capacity that you would point to as being under fixed fee contracts going forward, including Flexport?\n\nMarshall McCrea\n\nYes, Keith. So our spot prices, they're fixed when we negotiate each month. And then our term prices, they are fixed. So all the -- whether it's a three-year or four-year or five-year term, it's a fixed fee for us to load ethane, propane or butane onto these ships. Does that answer your question?\n\nKeith Stanley\n\nI guess I was trying to get at what percentage the mix? So what percentage is term contracts versus kind of month-to-month?\n\nMarshall McCrea\n\nSo the Flexport project that we're bringing on ethane and propane and then ethylene throughout the remainder of this year, fully contracted fixed price on average three to five years for the Flexport capacity that we're putting in service this year.\n\nOperator\n\nMichael Blum, Wells Fargo.\n\nMichael Blum\n\nI had a follow-up question on Hugh Brinson. So it sounds like you have more demand than your Phase 2 expansion. So I guess the question is, could you expand it further with compression? Or do you have another option? Would you somehow need to add another pipeline? And the other question related to that is, does this give you more pricing power and the ability to charge higher rates? Or could you see a higher return on a project like that?\n\nMarshall McCrea\n\nWell, let me just say our prices are always fair and competitive. We may have some markets on the phone. But no, anything like that, of course, we can always look pipe. We can always add compression. We actually now are looking at making Hugh Brinson fully bidirectional that's at a relatively inexpensive price to make that work.\n\nBut I guess to kind of round out the answer, we feel really good about the value of the capacity that we have yet to sell on Hugh Brinson and the amount of revenues that's going to create for our partnership, both from a west-to-east route as well as from an east to west out across Texas. So as I mentioned, we're very well positioned and we think we're going to do very well on adding significant value with all of these, not only data centers but with all the power plant opportunities that we have, not only in Texas, but in a number of other states.\n\nOperator\n\nManav Gupta, UBS.\n\nManav Gupta\n\nI wanted to ask you, it's been about six months since you have had a new President and a new government. Have things actually changed on the ground? Are you seeing more supportive permitting process? And in general, are you seeing more support for oil and gas industry from the new administration?\n\nMarshall McCrea\n\nYes, absolutely. We didn't expect it to be this big of an impact on things yet. But long term, we think the decisions that this administration will be very good for our country and very good for our industry and very good for our partnership.\n\nIn regards to permitting, it goes without saying that the pause around LNG, whatever pause there was left has been lifted the energy dominance Council under the Department of Interior is doing everything they can to learn about projects and to help projects get to the finish line where they make sense. As far as any extensions, for example, around our LNG project with FERC extensions or DOE extensions, we feel very good about getting those.\n\nSo general overall statement is things are much more positive. We think it will become much easier to build infrastructure with a lot more certainty for ourselves and for our customers and for the country. So as we talked about for the last four years, we are very excited about this new administration and where it's going to take this country and how our partnership will benefit from it.\n\nManav Gupta\n\nPerfect. My quick and easy follow-up here is your guidance still remains for 2025, 16.1% to 16.5%. And those of us really like ET, hope it's 16.5%. Help us understand, despite some of the small slowdowns that you are seeing, what could still get you closer to 16.5% versus the midpoint of the guidance?\n\nDylan Bramhall\n\nYes. This is Dylan here. So when we think about that guidance range. One thing I do want to point out is before I start here, we put out this range. We put out this range of $400 million, and that's on at a midpoint of $16.3 billion.\n\nSo if you think about that from the midpoint to the high and the low end, we're only going at less than 1.25% each way. So that's a pretty tight range. There's a lot of drivers in there. We feel really good about this plan when we put it out, and we still feel really good about it right now. It's the usual things, commodity price movements, spreads, those make up about 10% of our business there.\n\nAnd then there's a little bit of volume exposure as well within primarily the midstream segment. That's fairly muted as well. But those are really the drivers that can move us within that 2.5% range top to bottom end.\n\nOperator\n\nJohn Mackay, Goldman Sachs.\n\nJohn Mackay\n\nI wanted to talk about WTG for a second. It's been about, I guess, three quarters since you guys closed on that. Just anything you can kind of update us on in terms of how that asset is going right now, your ability to kind of ramp it up and start to retake share in the Midland. And then anything that's coming out of it on the NGL side that's given you some confidence on the contracting piece on the TMS side.\n\nMarshall McCrea\n\nThis is Mackie. I'll start and Dylan may want to follow up. But what a great acquisition, a tremendous amount of reserve and contracts dedicated to those assets. We have discovered as we've kind of started operating on some issues that have come up that we continue to address. But long term, we're excited about the growth, both from a cryogenic, from a gathering standpoint, but also from a downstream.\n\nWe mentioned Hugh Brinson. Hugh Brinson will be at the tailgate of the majority of the WTG cryos that'd be a great outlet when there's issues. We are having issues from time to time with the existing pipeline. So that will help in a big way. But as well as the NGLs, some of the NGLs are already dedicated. We do see growth in NGLs coming from these facilities in the future for our NGL pipeline in fracking business.\n\nBut all in all, we're very pleased about that asset and working hard to bring it up to the full standards of energy transfers, other assets. And it's going to be a great contributor to our partnership for many years to come.\n\nDylan Bramhall\n\nYes. (inaudible) I think when we look back versus our acquisition plan, as many of you recall, had a lot of maintenance (inaudible) maintenance capital in for the first years as we recognized there was going to be some work to do and we're definitely spending that capital. But on the plus side, the volumes are volumes are ahead of the plan that we had an acquisition.\n\nAnd so I think we're really pleased the producers behind the system are great partners, and we're seeing the financial benefits of that on the revenue side. So all in all, financially, this is going to turn out to be a great acquisition for us.\n\nJohn Mackay\n\nI appreciate that. And second, I want to be quick. Dylan, just going back to Manav's question on the guidance, not to belabor the point. But since the range is so tight, I just want to ask the $160 million benefit in midstream this quarter? Was that kind of expected inside the guide? And then how are you guys treating the remainder storm proceeds that you haven't recognized yet relative to that guidance range?\n\nDylan Bramhall\n\nYes. I would say that wasn't explicitly as part of the guide now. When we look at the guide, the one thing that somewhat offsets that is the first quarter in our guide we've assumed internally some volatility in there that we capture in the intrastate segment. I'll say, this first quarter, we did not have the volatility that we've seen in past years. And so we were short on that mark there. So this is a little bit of an offset there versus some stretch that we put into the business in the first quarter. So kind of consider that a wash as we go forward here.\n\nOperator\n\nGabe Moreen, Mizuho.\n\nGabriel Moreen\n\nI just had one follow-up on Lake Charles. Given, I guess, all the activity to try to get gas to the Gulf Coast for LNG exports and also the mid-ocean agreement saying that they'll use energy transfer pipes to get gas to their portion of the facility. Can you calibrate kind of the upstream opportunities on the pipe side now that you're getting close to FID, whether it's getting gas from the Haynesville across the border from Texas, just kind of your latest thoughts on how big that opportunity could be?\n\nMarshall McCrea\n\nYou bet. This is Mackie again. It's a huge opportunity. Yes, we do intend for all the molecules that come in Lake Charles will -- were somehow moved through our pipelines. We have the ability to move quite a bit of gas in that area today.\n\nWe will be needing to expand where exactly that expansion will come to and what size and timing and all that, we're still working through that depending on what the customers' desires are, but probably unlike any other we will have the ability to source from the Permian Basin, from cartridge, from Oklahoma, from Perryville, from North Louisiana, from East Texas, from Katy.\n\nSo with our extensive pipeline interstate network, we're having the ability to provide our customers and ourselves with access to the cheapest sources of supply, wherever those may be from all those points we just talked about. So we're still fine-tuning and finalizing what additional upstream pipelines will be necessary and those will be also to FID by the end of this year as well in conjunction with the Lake Charles.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Tom Long for closing remarks.\n\nThomas Long\n\nWell, thank you. And thank you to all of you for joining us. We're always very, very appreciative of your support, and we look forward to any follow-up questions you might have.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day. day.",
    "cleaned_text": "Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer first-quarter 2025 earnings call. Also, joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon. As a reminder, our earnings release contains a thorough MD A that goes through the segment results in detail, and we encourage everyone to look at the release as well as the slides posted to our website to gain a full understanding of the quarter and our growth opportunities. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, which we expect to file this Thursday, May 8. I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website. So let's start with our financial results today. For the first quarter of '25, we generated adjusted EBITDA of 4.1 billion compared to 3.9 billion for the first quarter of 2024. We saw strong volumes through our midstream gathering, crude gathering, natural gas interstate and NGL pipelines as well as through our NGL fractionators. In addition, we saw strong NGL exports during the quarter. DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was 2.3 billion. And for the first three months of 2025, we spent approximately 955 million on organic growth capital, primarily in the interstate, midstream and NGL and refined products segments excluding Sun and USA Compression CapEx. Now turning to our results by segment for the first quarter. Let's start with NGL and refined products, adjusted EBITDA was 978 million compared to 989 million for the first quarter of 2024. This was primarily due to higher throughput across the NGL export terminals and across our Permian and Mariner East pipeline operations, which were offset by higher operating expenses and lower blending margins compared to the first quarter of 2024. For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was 925 million compared to 696 million for the first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher legacy volumes in the Permian Basin, which were up 8 as well as the addition of the WTG assets in July of 2024. In addition, results for the first quarter of 2025 were favorably impacted by the nonrecurring recognition of 160 million associated with Winter Storm Uri in 2021. This represents the remainder of the midstream segment margin from Winter Storm Uri that had not already been recognized. Still outstanding in the intrastate segment is approximately 285 million, excluding interest, that is currently in litigation. The vast majority of which is due from CPS. For the crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was 742 million compared to 848 million for the first quarter of 2024. During the quarter, we saw growth across our crude gathering systems as well as contributions related to the recently formed Permian joint venture with Sun. These were offset by lower transportation revenues, primarily on the Bakken pipeline, higher expenses as well as lower gains due to the timing of the recognition of optimization gains in Q1 of 2025 as compared to Q1 2024. Lower optimization gains were primarily due to lower hedge gains realized during the quarter, a write-down to hedged inventory at the end of the quarter and the timing of the recognition of gains on certain physical crude sales. We expect approximately 30 million of losses related to the hedge inventory that were realized in the first quarter of 2025 to reverse during the second quarter of 2025. In our interstate natural gas segment, adjusted EBITDA was 512 million compared to 483 million for the first quarter of 2024. During the quarter, we achieved record volumes driven by higher throughput on Panhandle, Gulf Run and Trunkline. The growth on Trunkline was related to our backhaul project to support growing Gulf Coast natural gas demand. We also had increased rates on several of our pipelines in the first quarter. For the intrastate natural gas segment, adjusted EBITDA was 344 million compared to 438 million in the first quarter of last year. During the quarter, we saw increased gains related to storage optimization opportunities, which were more than offset by reduced pipeline optimization as a result of lower volatility in natural gas prices compared to the first quarter of 2024. Now let's take a look at the organic growth capital guidance. We continue to expect approximately 5 billion on organic growth capital projects in 2025. Our projects are expected to achieve mid-teen returns with most of them also providing incremental downstream benefits. In addition, the majority of these projects are expected online in 2025 or 2026, including our Flexport NGL export expansion, several Permian processing plant expansions and our Hugh Brinson pipeline project. As such, we continue to expect the majority of the earnings growth from these projects to significantly ramp up in 2026 and 2027. Taking a closer look at some of our largest growth projects that are currently underway. During the first quarter, we commenced construction on Phase 1 of the Hugh Brinson pipeline, which we expect to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2026. A we have secured the majority of the pipeline steel, which is currently being rolled in US pipe mills, and as a result, do not expect any material impacts to cost of the project from tariff announcements. Phase 1 is completely sold out, and we are currently in negotiations that are well in excess of Phase 2 capacity. At our Nederland Terminal, construction of our Flexport expansion project is nearing completion. We expect to begin ethane service later this month and propane service in July, and we continue to expect to begin ethylene export service in the fourth quarter of this year. Looking at our Permian processing expansions, the Red Lake 4 processing plant is now expected to be in service by the end of the second quarter of 2025. The Badger processing plant remains on schedule to be in service in mid-2025 and the Mustang Draw plant is now expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2026. Now let's look at Lake Charles LNG. We are making substantial progress towards commercialization of the project. In April, Lake Charles LNG and Mid-Ocean Energy signed a heads of agreement, which provides a nonbinding framework for the joint development of the LNG project. Pursuant to the HOA, Mid-Ocean would commit to fund 30 of the construction cost and be entitled to 30 of the LNG production. Mid-Ocean is an LNG company formed and managed by EIG Global Energy Partners. In April, Lake Charles LNG signed a binding SPA with a Japanese utility company for up to 1 MTPA with the agreement subject to the approval of the Board of this company, which is expected to be received by the end of May. Also, in April, we signed an HOA with a German energy company for 1 MTPA. Lake Charles LNG is in discussions for the remaining uncommitted LNG offtake volume and is targeting FID by year-end. Now for a brief update around our power generation opportunities the level of activity from demand pull customers has remained strong. And we're in advanced discussions with several other facilities in close proximity to our footprint to supply store and transport natural gas from gas-fired power plants, data centers, and industrial and onshore manufacturing. On our last earnings call, we were excited to announce that we have entered into a long-term agreement with CloudBurst data centers to provide natural gas to their flagship AI-focused data center development in Central Texas. We would expect these types of projects to require very low capital and to generate revenue relatively quickly. There is a lot of competition around these projects, but our team has done an excellent job of identifying the most likely opportunities, and we will continue to provide updates as we move forward. Lastly, construction of 8, 10-megawatt natural gas-fired electric generation facilities continues. The first facility was placed into service in the first quarter, and we expect the next one to be in service by the end of the second quarter. With the remainder expected to be in service throughout 2025 and 2026. And now turning to our guidance. We continue to expect our 2025 adjusted EBITDA to be between 16.1 billion and 16.5 billion. We benefit from an integrated business model that is well diversified by products and geography. Our cash flows are highly fee-based with limited commodity price exposure and financially, our balance sheet is in the strongest position in our history. We also have a high percentage of take-or-pay contracts helping to reduce impacts from market volatility. We are executing on a solid backlog of well contracted growth projects with strong counterparties, which are expected to generate strong returns, enhance our integrated value chain and promote strong growth. We will start to see contributions from some of these projects this year with additional benefits really ramping up next year as we quickly convert CapEx into cash flow. Given Energy Transfer's extensive natural gas infrastructure, we are excited to see the growing demand in and around our franchise to support power plant data center and LNG growth. With our diverse integrated asset base and strong financial position, we believe we are well positioned to manage volatility while we continue to grow. Before we close, we'd like to take a moment to mention Sunoco's recently announced plans to acquire Parkland Corporation. We are excited for SUN as they work to bring these assets into the family of partnerships. This combination is expected to create the largest independent field distributor in the Americas. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, please open the line up for our first question. Story Continues Question and Answer Session Operator Operator Instructions Theresa Chen, Barclays. Theresa Chen I'd like to first ask on the Lake Charles progress. Looking to your year-end target FID, can you talk about additional steps from here either from a commercialization financing or permitting a regulatory perspective? And more broadly, how do you think US LNG is situated given increasing competitive dynamics domestically as well as increasing demand abroad with the EU commission proposing to phase out imports of all Russian gas and LNG. Marshall McCrea Theresa, this is Mackie. We continue to gain momentum and be excited about getting to FID. We've worked many, many years on this project. We've got teams over as we speak. In fact, even on this call moments ago, we got a text. We signed up another 1 million tons from a large international energy company. So we're very excited. However, we've still got work to do. We now pass 10.4 million tons. We're targeting about 15 million tons. As Tom just said on his opening statements, we have a big partner in this now. We're looking for other partners where at the end of the day, we won about 75 to 80 equity and or infrastructure partners still have that box to check. We are finalizing our EPC cost over these next couple of months and everything is looking good. Like I said, we've got a lot of work to do, but we're very excited about where we're at, and we're also very excited about the new administration that will not hold up. In fact, we'll promote these types of projects, not only benefit our country, our partnership, but also our friends around the world that so desperately need LNG. So we're excited about a lot of work to do and certainly hope we reach FID by the end of the year. As far as the second question you had, kind of hard to address that, we feel pretty good where our prices are. We know there's a lot of competition out there. Some are already at FID. Some aren't. We're successful in continuing to price our capacity in a manner that works for our returns. So we kind of don't worry and think much about what others are doing. We focus on what we've got, and we're excited and are hopeful to get there by the end of the year. Theresa Chen And with one of your portfolio companies getting a currency soon potentially, how does that parlay into the potential for energy transfer to also have a C corp presence? What are your thoughts on that topic at this point? Thomas Long Theresa, this is Tom. We've always had that on the options list, if you will. We continue to evaluate it and see what makes sense from an energy transfer standpoint. Obviously, very excited to see SUN to be able to first execute on one, and we'll evaluate that carefully. But as we sit here right now, it's really not any more plans than probably we had before this transaction as far as energy transfer goes. So it's an option, and we're going to continue to look at it, and we'll stay tuned. Operator Jeremy Tonet, JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet I was just curious, given the volatility we have seen in commodity prices and we're starting to see some rigs being dropped even in the Permian. Just wondering, I guess, with your latest producer customer conversations, what your outlook is for production, if that has changed meaningfully? Or how do you expect it to impact the Energy Transfer? Marshall McCrea Okay. This is Mackie again. Typically, I'll make a brief statement at the end. Sometimes I'll make a brief statement real quick. And I think it's important for this question and also for other questions that might come up. We were talking a couple of weeks ago and a lot of us have been in this business for 35, 40 years, someone like Tom, longer than that. But anyway, we've seen a lot of cycles. It's a very cyclical business. And we've seen gas at 1.50. We've seen gas at 8 or 9. We've seen oil at less than 10. We've seen oil at 120. We've had quarters where we were panicked about what the spread is between Waha and Katy because we were a natural gas pipeline company. And fortunately, where we are today with Kelsey's leadership and guidance is we're the most diversified kind of unparalleled midstream pipeline company in the United States. And just quickly a few comments on that. In addition to kind of our segments, we've got our USA compression run by Clint, who's doing a great job of not only maintaining what they have, but look for growth over the coming years. We got Joe Kim and his team with Sunoco. He's done an incredible job with the assets they purchased. Now they just made a huge announcement that we see a lot of upside for them. Of course, that also provides additional distributions, which don't hurt our feelings at all. And then you look at our segment, you look at our Crude segment, run by Adam and his team. And we move about 20 of the barrels out of West Texas, about 30 of the barrels that are produced in the United States go through our pipes, over 50 in the Bakken. We're one of the largest deliverers of barrels to the refineries around Port Arthur and then, of course, Bayou Bridge to the Lake Charles and St. James, and then on and so forth, up the Mid-Continent. Then you jump over to the NGLs and the massive pipelines we've built with Mariner and we are the company to go to with any ethane, propane growth out of the Northeast through our Marcus Hook terminal. And then, of course, our incredible expansion at Nederland that we're also completing our next 250,000 in our NGL world where we move a lot of barrels, over 1 million barrels a day go into that. Very excited about that. And of course, midstream. We've got a big presence in the Permian and a lot of other places. And then you look at what's going on in the pipeline -- our intrastate, our interstate and how well we've built all those out from all the major basins, delivering to all the major markets, whether it's LNG or whether it's power plants or the utilities or cities or whatever, we just have positioned ourselves in such a good way to where if one segment slows down or whatever, the other one picks it back up. So all that saying, going to your question, yes, we are seeing a slowdown a little bit over the last few weeks. We actually have been in conversations, Tom and I have, with some of the majors. They really haven't indicated at these kind of 50 barrel of pricing that necessarily going to slow down. But we have seen even in the last day, yesterday and today, there's been some statements on slowdown. We're well positioned to manage that. This is what happens in this industry. It will slow down and then it will come back as a barn burner. We certainly anticipate that happening with oil but even tenfold on gas. Any kind of slowdown on gas, if you look over the next 3 or 4 years, 5 to 7 Bcf of growth in the LNG market, who knows where the AI data center and power plants are going to go on a high side or even a medium side on that. I mean, it's just a wonderful outlook for our pipeline business, both intra and interstate. So yes, there's areas where drilling has slowed down. It will slow down some parts of that. But as a whole, we think some of the other areas of our well-balanced partnership will kind of even things out and we just stay very positive and bullish on the future, especially around NGLs and natural gas transportation. Jeremy Tonet Got you. Makes sense. Yes, I know it's certainly important to have a diversified platform there. It seems like a slowdown in oil could help the gas supply demand dynamics and could help you out there as well. And maybe just building a gas a bit more, I guess, the opportunity set as you see it to service growing power demand in data centers even and thinking particularly to the west of Texas, just wondering how you see, I guess, the opportunity set to feed more power in Texas or data centers and also further West in Arizona as well. Marshall McCrea Yes. I'll tell you, this is one of those areas where we feel like we're sitting on a gold mine. As I just mentioned, we built a lot of assets, bought a lot of pipeline assets, moving molecules from production basins to markets. We wake up here over the last 6 to 12 months and find ourselves in an incredible position. Adam and his team are -- you got a really good team he's put together to chase deals all over Texas. There's 150 approximate data centers that we're looking at just in Texas alone, we would love to elaborate and talk about some significant progress we make. We do believe in the next four to six weeks, we'll be able to make some significant announcements. But what's really cool about our assets, and we've said this before, is that if we were going to go out and develop. And we're kind of doing this to a certain degree to help some of the hyperscalers and try to place some of these data centers. We place them almost right on top of our pipes. In fact, like we said last time, CloudBurst location, our pipeline actually runs through that acreage. But we're so well positioned from an electrical transmission standpoint, a lot of the major electric lines running through Texas parallel or very close to our pipelines. A lot of the low latency fiber optics runs in the same quarter as our pipeline. So we're very optimistic. We'd love to elaborate. Yes, even outside of Texas, we see Arizona as a very significant growth area for data centers, really growth area for natural gas demand in addition to data centers elsewhere in other states call from other states, we expect to make some significant announcements over the next four to eight weeks. So a little premature, but very excited about where that's going to take us and couldn't be couldn't feel better about our situation on where our pipeline sit. Our ability to move large volumes through these large diameter systems in the storage, we have to back up that. We just couldn't be more excited about these opportunities we're chasing. Jeremy Tonet Got it. We'll be listening in the coming weeks for that announcement. Operator Jean Ann Salisbury, Bank of America. Jean Ann Salisbury Thank you for the update on the timing of the ethane and propane in service for the Nederland Flexport expansion that starts in the next few months. Can you speak to how you're viewing the speed of the ramp for that project? And if you expect it to mainly be shipping propane or ethane in the medium term? Marshall McCrea Yes, this is Mackie again. I believe we're coming on the end of this month, early next month with ethane. Regardless of what everybody is hearing about all the negativity around what's going on in China and other areas, we're not having a problem finding a home for our product or ethane or LPG. In fact, we did a deal this morning for another ethane spot cargo to China. So with those tariffs apparently being method around ethane and possibly LPG, we feel very good about it. July or August, we'll be ramping up the propane portion of that. And then by the end of this year, ethylene. All of that, we expect on a spot basis and or some of it's turned up to stay very full for the second half of this year. And then we're on this new flexible expansion, we're over 90 sold out under 3- to 5-year agreement starting January 1 of '26. So we're very excited about that. It needs to come online for the international demand around the world. And we're excited to finally for all that hundreds of millions of dollars were spent, we're excited about the revenue that we're about to bring in the door. Jean Ann Salisbury Great. That's super helpful. And then you kind of touched on this, but my follow-up was just real time what you're seeing in the LPG export market. Is there basically enough ring rerouting, I guess, going on to avoid the China tariff on US LPG. And how do you think that plays out in the next few months? Marshall McCrea Yes. With all these questions, a lot of uncertainty about what's going on in the industry. We have very little concern, even talking to our team today, as I just said, there's a lot of international demand, not just China, all over the world for ethane, propane and butane, and we really don't expect to see any major challenges if any challenges at all selling out our terminal every month, the rest of this year. Operator Spiro Dounis, Citi. Spiro Dounis Maybe just to go to Hugh Brinson, Tom, you pointed out that negotiations now are well in excess of that Phase 2 capacity. So multipart question here. One, what does that mean for the timing of Phase 2? Is there an ability to accelerate that now? And does this actually create some bottlenecks, maybe even downstream of Hugh Brinson where that could precipitate more expansions? And then lastly, what kind of customers are you dealing with here? Is this largely data center-driven demand? Marshall McCrea Yes. This is Mackie again, Spiro. I tell you, it's funny we've been trying to get a 42-inch across Texas FID for, I don't even know, 4 or 5 years, and we finally got that done, and it couldn't have been better timing, especially larger last question was related data centers. However, getting that to FID had nothing to do with data centers, not one data center supported that project to get it off the ground. As we've said, we have sold out now Phase 1. We are in negotiations with -- I wouldn't say twice as much, but significantly more volume request and we have capacity available to take it from 1.5 Bcf to 2.2 Bcf. But as I was just alluding to what an incredible time to announce a new 42-inch, 2.2 Bcf pipeline out of the most prolific basin in the United States that connects to multiple 42- and 36-inch pipes of ours that feeds markets throughout the state of Texas and then also, of course, accesses Carthage and tax owed to feed the Southeast, LNG, everything else. So we're very excited about that. And then as far as data centers, we call it kind of the gold rush. It's something where not only is it -- are we working with customers that we will end up probably utilizing some of the remainder capacity we have available. We also have customers that want diversification of receipt points, meaning they may want some from Waha, some from Katy, some from Carthage. We're able to accommodate that with this massive system we've built. So we're in such a good situation very excited about. As I keep saying, we can't express our excitement enough and one kind of exclamation point on this. Tying in all these, it's not just data centers. That's one thing that we probably need to elaborate on. We're negotiating with as many power plants unassociated with data centers that we think are more likely to happen just because of the need, especially here in Texas to meet the growing demand from population, et cetera. So kind of the exclamation point is there's not a lot of capital to this. As I mentioned earlier, a lot of these areas where these data centers are proposed are right on top of us. So we're talking about moving 250,000, 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 in different directions with some good healthy margins and yet we're laying a mile of -- 5 miles of pipe. So it's exciting enough time. I'll say it again, we're thrilled with this new opportunity for our pipeline assets and very excited where that's going to take revenues for those assets in the future. Spiro Dounis It's great to hear, Mackie. Second question, maybe this one for you as well. And I kind of want to go back to Jeremy's original question. Ask it a different way and hopefully not make you repeat yourself. Your point is well taken. I think over longer-term periods, you've proven to be pretty durable and resilient duty cycles. I guess we narrow the focus a little bit. Obviously, a lot of projects coming online this year, 5 billion of CapEx in the hopper here. And I think last time we caught up, it did suggest you'd be sort of at the higher end of your sort of 3 to 5 growth rate this year and maybe next year. And so I guess I'm curious, given everything we've seen, I realize a lot of uncertainty still, crude in the 50s. There's still feel like that 5 billion of CapEx is got enough hardwired growth inside of it to still drive 5 growth or maybe some of that come off a bit. Marshall McCrea That's a good question. And certainly, we're always looking at everything. Every impact we might have on our system with some of the statements that have come out even recently, one thing we were joking about before this call is every time we bring on a plant, we just brought on Lenora 1 here not too long ago within days. Certainly within weeks, it's full. And so when we bring on Lenora 2 here in the next 30, 45 days, we don't know how full it's going to be. Our expectations are, it's going to fill up pretty fast. But we do have the luxury of kind of watching what happens over the next quarter, maybe 1.5 quarters, 2 quarters. And if we really do see a slowdown, we will have the ability to defer some of these costs. We can delay Mustang draw, certainly not talk about -- think about that or anything right now on that. but it's certainly a tool and something that we can look at as well as other projects that we have. If we see a huge downturn and it's extended for some period of time, we will be able to push some of that 5 billion into 26 billion. But way premature to any kind of that type of -- I wouldn't say panic, but any of that type of moves. We remain bullish Yes, we see some softening. Yes, we see some potential challenges over the next quarter or two. But a year, 2 years through 10 years, we're extremely bullish on our industry and on the need for all the products that we transport. And we'll just see how the next quarter plays out before we make some of those decisions. Operator Keith Stanley, Wolfe Research. Keith Stanley Two follow-ups on that. So on the CapEx conversation, Tom, is there a figure that you have just roughly, if we're talking 5 billion of growth CapEx this year. What would that look like based on just sanctioned projects right now for 2026? Does that number come down a lot? Or how are you looking at that and flexibility for '26 spend? Thomas Long Yes, Keith. That's actually a very good question. Of course, we generally don't give our guidance for the current year until the end of the year. But when you really look out and you probably look at a lot of these projects that we're talking about coming on right now, we don't have that same size number currently filled up. But we do have, as always, a big backlog of projects to look at. So I don't really have an answer for you on how to guide. But probably take it to less than half of that is probably where I would take it with you, Keith. So let's see how the year continues to develop. But as we sit here right now, that's probably a good marker without it being guidance, though. Keith Stanley Okay. So less than half of the 5 billion is sanctioned today, and obviously, that can change over time. Thomas Long That's inaudible Keith Stanley Okay. That's very helpful. The second follow-up, I just wanted to check on the contracting position just across NGL exports. And so I think, Mackie, you said you expect to fully sell out on a spot basis, all of your available export capacity. We also said Flexport is 90 contracted for 3 to 5 years. Just looking holistically at your NGL export portfolio, is there a percentage of capacity that you would point to as being under fixed fee contracts going forward, including Flexport? Marshall McCrea Yes, Keith. So our spot prices, they're fixed when we negotiate each month. And then our term prices, they are fixed. So all the -- whether it's a three-year or four-year or five-year term, it's a fixed fee for us to load ethane, propane or butane onto these ships. Does that answer your question? Keith Stanley I guess I was trying to get at what percentage the mix? So what percentage is term contracts versus kind of month-to-month? Marshall McCrea So the Flexport project that we're bringing on ethane and propane and then ethylene throughout the remainder of this year, fully contracted fixed price on average three to five years for the Flexport capacity that we're putting in service this year. Operator Michael Blum, Wells Fargo. Michael Blum I had a follow-up question on Hugh Brinson. So it sounds like you have more demand than your Phase 2 expansion. So I guess the question is, could you expand it further with compression? Or do you have another option? Would you somehow need to add another pipeline? And the other question related to that is, does this give you more pricing power and the ability to charge higher rates? Or could you see a higher return on a project like that? Marshall McCrea Well, let me just say our prices are always fair and competitive. We may have some markets on the phone. But no, anything like that, of course, we can always look pipe. We can always add compression. We actually now are looking at making Hugh Brinson fully bidirectional that's at a relatively inexpensive price to make that work. But I guess to kind of round out the answer, we feel really good about the value of the capacity that we have yet to sell on Hugh Brinson and the amount of revenues that's going to create for our partnership, both from a west-to-east route as well as from an east to west out across Texas. So as I mentioned, we're very well positioned and we think we're going to do very well on adding significant value with all of these, not only data centers but with all the power plant opportunities that we have, not only in Texas, but in a number of other states. Operator Manav Gupta, UBS. Manav Gupta I wanted to ask you, it's been about six months since you have had a new President and a new government. Have things actually changed on the ground? Are you seeing more supportive permitting process? And in general, are you seeing more support for oil and gas industry from the new administration? Marshall McCrea Yes, absolutely. We didn't expect it to be this big of an impact on things yet. But long term, we think the decisions that this administration will be very good for our country and very good for our industry and very good for our partnership. In regards to permitting, it goes without saying that the pause around LNG, whatever pause there was left has been lifted the energy dominance Council under the Department of Interior is doing everything they can to learn about projects and to help projects get to the finish line where they make sense. As far as any extensions, for example, around our LNG project with FERC extensions or DOE extensions, we feel very good about getting those. So general overall statement is things are much more positive. We think it will become much easier to build infrastructure with a lot more certainty for ourselves and for our customers and for the country. So as we talked about for the last four years, we are very excited about this new administration and where it's going to take this country and how our partnership will benefit from it. Manav Gupta Perfect. My quick and easy follow-up here is your guidance still remains for 2025, 16.1 to 16.5 . And those of us really like ET, hope it's 16.5 . Help us understand, despite some of the small slowdowns that you are seeing, what could still get you closer to 16.5 versus the midpoint of the guidance? Dylan Bramhall Yes. This is Dylan here. So when we think about that guidance range. One thing I do want to point out is before I start here, we put out this range. We put out this range of 400 million, and that's on at a midpoint of 16.3 billion. So if you think about that from the midpoint to the high and the low end, we're only going at less than 1.25 each way. So that's a pretty tight range. There's a lot of drivers in there. We feel really good about this plan when we put it out, and we still feel really good about it right now. It's the usual things, commodity price movements, spreads, those make up about 10 of our business there. And then there's a little bit of volume exposure as well within primarily the midstream segment. That's fairly muted as well. But those are really the drivers that can move us within that 2.5 range top to bottom end. Operator John Mackay, Goldman Sachs. John Mackay I wanted to talk about WTG for a second. It's been about, I guess, three quarters since you guys closed on that. Just anything you can kind of update us on in terms of how that asset is going right now, your ability to kind of ramp it up and start to retake share in the Midland. And then anything that's coming out of it on the NGL side that's given you some confidence on the contracting piece on the TMS side. Marshall McCrea This is Mackie. I'll start and Dylan may want to follow up. But what a great acquisition, a tremendous amount of reserve and contracts dedicated to those assets. We have discovered as we've kind of started operating on some issues that have come up that we continue to address. But long term, we're excited about the growth, both from a cryogenic, from a gathering standpoint, but also from a downstream. We mentioned Hugh Brinson. Hugh Brinson will be at the tailgate of the majority of the WTG cryos that'd be a great outlet when there's issues. We are having issues from time to time with the existing pipeline. So that will help in a big way. But as well as the NGLs, some of the NGLs are already dedicated. We do see growth in NGLs coming from these facilities in the future for our NGL pipeline in fracking business. But all in all, we're very pleased about that asset and working hard to bring it up to the full standards of energy transfers, other assets. And it's going to be a great contributor to our partnership for many years to come. Dylan Bramhall Yes. inaudible I think when we look back versus our acquisition plan, as many of you recall, had a lot of maintenance inaudible maintenance capital in for the first years as we recognized there was going to be some work to do and we're definitely spending that capital. But on the plus side, the volumes are volumes are ahead of the plan that we had an acquisition. And so I think we're really pleased the producers behind the system are great partners, and we're seeing the financial benefits of that on the revenue side. So all in all, financially, this is going to turn out to be a great acquisition for us. John Mackay I appreciate that. And second, I want to be quick. Dylan, just going back to Manav's question on the guidance, not to belabor the point. But since the range is so tight, I just want to ask the 160 million benefit in midstream this quarter? Was that kind of expected inside the guide? And then how are you guys treating the remainder storm proceeds that you haven't recognized yet relative to that guidance range? Dylan Bramhall Yes. I would say that wasn't explicitly as part of the guide now. When we look at the guide, the one thing that somewhat offsets that is the first quarter in our guide we've assumed internally some volatility in there that we capture in the intrastate segment. I'll say, this first quarter, we did not have the volatility that we've seen in past years. And so we were short on that mark there. So this is a little bit of an offset there versus some stretch that we put into the business in the first quarter. So kind of consider that a wash as we go forward here. Operator Gabe Moreen, Mizuho. Gabriel Moreen I just had one follow-up on Lake Charles. Given, I guess, all the activity to try to get gas to the Gulf Coast for LNG exports and also the mid-ocean agreement saying that they'll use energy transfer pipes to get gas to their portion of the facility. Can you calibrate kind of the upstream opportunities on the pipe side now that you're getting close to FID, whether it's getting gas from the Haynesville across the border from Texas, just kind of your latest thoughts on how big that opportunity could be? Marshall McCrea You bet. This is Mackie again. It's a huge opportunity. Yes, we do intend for all the molecules that come in Lake Charles will -- were somehow moved through our pipelines. We have the ability to move quite a bit of gas in that area today. We will be needing to expand where exactly that expansion will come to and what size and timing and all that, we're still working through that depending on what the customers' desires are, but probably unlike any other we will have the ability to source from the Permian Basin, from cartridge, from Oklahoma, from Perryville, from North Louisiana, from East Texas, from Katy. So with our extensive pipeline interstate network, we're having the ability to provide our customers and ourselves with access to the cheapest sources of supply, wherever those may be from all those points we just talked about. So we're still fine-tuning and finalizing what additional upstream pipelines will be necessary and those will be also to FID by the end of this year as well in conjunction with the Lake Charles. Operator This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Tom Long for closing remarks. Thomas Long Well, thank you. And thank you to all of you for joining us. We're always very, very appreciative of your support, and we look forward to any follow-up questions you might have. Operator Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day. day.",

      "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Energy Transfer first-quarter 2025 earnings call.",
      "Also, joined today by Mackie McCrea and other members of the senior management team, who are here to help answer your questions after our prepared remarks.",
      "Hopefully, you saw the press release we issued earlier this afternoon.",
      "As a reminder, our earnings release contains a thorough MD A that goes through the segment results in detail, and we encourage everyone to look at the release as well as the slides posted to our website to gain a full understanding of the quarter and our growth opportunities.",
      "As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.",
      "These statements are based upon our current beliefs as well as certain assumptions and information currently available to us and are discussed in more detail in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, which we expect to file this Thursday, May 8.",
      "I'll also refer to adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow, or DCF, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures.",
      "You'll find a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures on our website.",
      "So let's start with our financial results today.",
      "For the first quarter of '25, we generated adjusted EBITDA of 4.1 billion compared to 3.9 billion for the first quarter of 2024.",
      "We saw strong volumes through our midstream gathering, crude gathering, natural gas interstate and NGL pipelines as well as through our NGL fractionators.",
      "In addition, we saw strong NGL exports during the quarter.",
      "DCF attributable to the partners of Energy Transfer, as adjusted, was 2.3 billion.",
      "And for the first three months of 2025, we spent approximately 955 million on organic growth capital, primarily in the interstate, midstream and NGL and refined products segments excluding Sun and USA Compression CapEx.",
      "Now turning to our results by segment for the first quarter.",
      "Let's start with NGL and refined products, adjusted EBITDA was 978 million compared to 989 million for the first quarter of 2024.",
      "This was primarily due to higher throughput across the NGL export terminals and across our Permian and Mariner East pipeline operations, which were offset by higher operating expenses and lower blending margins compared to the first quarter of 2024.",
      "For midstream, adjusted EBITDA was 925 million compared to 696 million for the first quarter of 2024.",
      "The increase was primarily due to higher legacy volumes in the Permian Basin, which were up 8 as well as the addition of the WTG assets in July of 2024.",
      "In addition, results for the first quarter of 2025 were favorably impacted by the nonrecurring recognition of 160 million associated with Winter Storm Uri in 2021.",
      "This represents the remainder of the midstream segment margin from Winter Storm Uri that had not already been recognized.",
      "Still outstanding in the intrastate segment is approximately 285 million, excluding interest, that is currently in litigation.",
      "The vast majority of which is due from CPS.",
      "For the crude oil segment, adjusted EBITDA was 742 million compared to 848 million for the first quarter of 2024.",
      "During the quarter, we saw growth across our crude gathering systems as well as contributions related to the recently formed Permian joint venture with Sun.",
      "These were offset by lower transportation revenues, primarily on the Bakken pipeline, higher expenses as well as lower gains due to the timing of the recognition of optimization gains in Q1 of 2025 as compared to Q1 2024.",
      "Lower optimization gains were primarily due to lower hedge gains realized during the quarter, a write-down to hedged inventory at the end of the quarter and the timing of the recognition of gains on certain physical crude sales.",
      "We expect approximately 30 million of losses related to the hedge inventory that were realized in the first quarter of 2025 to reverse during the second quarter of 2025.",
      "In our interstate natural gas segment, adjusted EBITDA was 512 million compared to 483 million for the first quarter of 2024.",
      "During the quarter, we achieved record volumes driven by higher throughput on Panhandle, Gulf Run and Trunkline.",
      "The growth on Trunkline was related to our backhaul project to support growing Gulf Coast natural gas demand.",
      "We also had increased rates on several of our pipelines in the first quarter.",
      "For the intrastate natural gas segment, adjusted EBITDA was 344 million compared to 438 million in the first quarter of last year.",
      "During the quarter, we saw increased gains related to storage optimization opportunities, which were more than offset by reduced pipeline optimization as a result of lower volatility in natural gas prices compared to the first quarter of 2024.",
      "Now let's take a look at the organic growth capital guidance.",
      "We continue to expect approximately 5 billion on organic growth capital projects in 2025.",
      "Our projects are expected to achieve mid-teen returns with most of them also providing incremental downstream benefits.",
      "In addition, the majority of these projects are expected online in 2025 or 2026, including our Flexport NGL export expansion, several Permian processing plant expansions and our Hugh Brinson pipeline project.",
      "As such, we continue to expect the majority of the earnings growth from these projects to significantly ramp up in 2026 and 2027.",
      "Taking a closer look at some of our largest growth projects that are currently underway.",
      "During the first quarter, we commenced construction on Phase 1 of the Hugh Brinson pipeline, which we expect to be in service in the fourth quarter of 2026.",
      "A we have secured the majority of the pipeline steel, which is currently being rolled in US pipe mills, and as a result, do not expect any material impacts to cost of the project from tariff announcements.",
      "Phase 1 is completely sold out, and we are currently in negotiations that are well in excess of Phase 2 capacity.",
      "At our Nederland Terminal, construction of our Flexport expansion project is nearing completion.",
      "We expect to begin ethane service later this month and propane service in July, and we continue to expect to begin ethylene export service in the fourth quarter of this year.",
      "Looking at our Permian processing expansions, the Red Lake 4 processing plant is now expected to be in service by the end of the second quarter of 2025.",
      "The Badger processing plant remains on schedule to be in service in mid-2025 and the Mustang Draw plant is now expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2026.",
      "Now let's look at Lake Charles LNG.",
      "We are making substantial progress towards commercialization of the project.",
      "In April, Lake Charles LNG and Mid-Ocean Energy signed a heads of agreement, which provides a nonbinding framework for the joint development of the LNG project.",
      "Pursuant to the HOA, Mid-Ocean would commit to fund 30 of the construction cost and be entitled to 30 of the LNG production.",
      "Mid-Ocean is an LNG company formed and managed by EIG Global Energy Partners.",
      "In April, Lake Charles LNG signed a binding SPA with a Japanese utility company for up to 1 MTPA with the agreement subject to the approval of the Board of this company, which is expected to be received by the end of May.",
      "Also, in April, we signed an HOA with a German energy company for 1 MTPA.",
      "Lake Charles LNG is in discussions for the remaining uncommitted LNG offtake volume and is targeting FID by year-end.",
      "Now for a brief update around our power generation opportunities the level of activity from demand pull customers has remained strong.",
      "And we're in advanced discussions with several other facilities in close proximity to our footprint to supply store and transport natural gas from gas-fired power plants, data centers, and industrial and onshore manufacturing.",
      "On our last earnings call, we were excited to announce that we have entered into a long-term agreement with CloudBurst data centers to provide natural gas to their flagship AI-focused data center development in Central Texas.",
      "We would expect these types of projects to require very low capital and to generate revenue relatively quickly.",
      "There is a lot of competition around these projects, but our team has done an excellent job of identifying the most likely opportunities, and we will continue to provide updates as we move forward.",
      "Lastly, construction of 8, 10-megawatt natural gas-fired electric generation facilities continues.",
      "The first facility was placed into service in the first quarter, and we expect the next one to be in service by the end of the second quarter.",
      "With the remainder expected to be in service throughout 2025 and 2026.",
      "And now turning to our guidance.",
      "We continue to expect our 2025 adjusted EBITDA to be between 16.1 billion and 16.5 billion.",
      "We benefit from an integrated business model that is well diversified by products and geography.",
      "Our cash flows are highly fee-based with limited commodity price exposure and financially, our balance sheet is in the strongest position in our history.",
      "We also have a high percentage of take-or-pay contracts helping to reduce impacts from market volatility.",
      "We are executing on a solid backlog of well contracted growth projects with strong counterparties, which are expected to generate strong returns, enhance our integrated value chain and promote strong growth.",
      "We will start to see contributions from some of these projects this year with additional benefits really ramping up next year as we quickly convert CapEx into cash flow.",
      "Given Energy Transfer's extensive natural gas infrastructure, we are excited to see the growing demand in and around our franchise to support power plant data center and LNG growth.",
      "With our diverse integrated asset base and strong financial position, we believe we are well positioned to manage volatility while we continue to grow.",
      "Before we close, we'd like to take a moment to mention Sunoco's recently announced plans to acquire Parkland Corporation.",
      "We are excited for SUN as they work to bring these assets into the family of partnerships.",
      "This combination is expected to create the largest independent field distributor in the Americas.",

      "Story Continues Question and Answer Session Operator Operator Instructions Theresa Chen, Barclays.",
      "Theresa Chen",
      "I'd like to first ask on the Lake Charles progress.",
      "Looking to your year-end target FID, can you talk about additional steps from here either from a commercialization financing or permitting a regulatory perspective?",
      "And more broadly, how do you think US LNG is situated given increasing competitive dynamics domestically as well as increasing demand abroad with the EU commission proposing to phase out imports of all Russian gas and LNG.",
      "Marshall McCrea Theresa, this is Mackie.",
      "We continue to gain momentum and be excited about getting to FID.",
      "We've worked many, many years on this project.",
      "We've got teams over as we speak.",
      "In fact, even on this call moments ago, we got a text.",
      "We signed up another 1 million tons from a large international energy company.",
      "So we're very excited.",
      "However, we've still got work to do.",
      "We now pass 10.4 million tons.",
      "We're targeting about 15 million tons.",
      "As Tom just said on his opening statements, we have a big partner in this now.",
      "We're looking for other partners where at the end of the day, we won about 75 to 80 equity and or infrastructure partners still have that box to check.",
      "We are finalizing our EPC cost over these next couple of months and everything is looking good.",
      "Like I said, we've got a lot of work to do, but we're very excited about where we're at, and we're also very excited about the new administration that will not hold up.",
      "In fact, we'll promote these types of projects, not only benefit our country, our partnership, but also our friends around the world that so desperately need LNG.",
      "So we're excited about a lot of work to do and certainly hope we reach FID by the end of the year.",
      "As far as the second question you had, kind of hard to address that, we feel pretty good where our prices are.",
      "We know there's a lot of competition out there.",
      "Some are already at FID.",
      "Some aren't.",
      "We're successful in continuing to price our capacity in a manner that works for our returns.",
      "So we kind of don't worry and think much about what others are doing.",
      "We focus on what we've got, and we're excited and are hopeful to get there by the end of the year.",
      "Theresa Chen",
      "And with one of your portfolio companies getting a currency soon potentially, how does that parlay into the potential for energy transfer to also have a C corp presence?",
      "What are your thoughts on that topic at this point?",
      "Thomas Long Theresa, this is Tom.",
      "We've always had that on the options list, if you will.",
      "We continue to evaluate it and see what makes sense from an energy transfer standpoint.",
      "Obviously, very excited to see SUN to be able to first execute on one, and we'll evaluate that carefully.",
      "But as we sit here right now, it's really not any more plans than probably we had before this transaction as far as energy transfer goes.",
      "So it's an option, and we're going to continue to look at it, and we'll stay tuned.",
      "Operator Jeremy Tonet, JPMorgan.",
      "Jeremy Tonet I was just curious, given the volatility we have seen in commodity prices and we're starting to see some rigs being dropped even in the Permian.",
      "Just wondering, I guess, with your latest producer customer conversations, what your outlook is for production, if that has changed meaningfully?",
      "Or how do you expect it to impact the Energy Transfer?",
      "Marshall McCrea Okay.",
      "This is Mackie again.",
      "Typically, I'll make a brief statement at the end.",
      "Sometimes I'll make a brief statement real quick.",
      "And I think it's important for this question and also for other questions that might come up.",
      "We were talking a couple of weeks ago and a lot of us have been in this business for 35, 40 years, someone like Tom, longer than that.",
      "But anyway, we've seen a lot of cycles.",
      "It's a very cyclical business.",
      "And we've seen gas at 1.50.",
      "We've seen gas at 8 or 9.",
      "We've seen oil at less than 10.",
      "We've seen oil at 120.",
      "We've had quarters where we were panicked about what the spread is between Waha and Katy because we were a natural gas pipeline company.",
      "And fortunately, where we are today with Kelsey's leadership and guidance is we're the most diversified kind of unparalleled midstream pipeline company in the United States.",
      "And just quickly a few comments on that.",
      "In addition to kind of our segments, we've got our USA compression run by Clint, who's doing a great job of not only maintaining what they have, but look for growth over the coming years.",
      "We got Joe Kim and his team with Sunoco.",
      "He's done an incredible job with the assets they purchased.",
      "Now they just made a huge announcement that we see a lot of upside for them.",
      "Of course, that also provides additional distributions, which don't hurt our feelings at all.",
      "And then you look at our segment, you look at our Crude segment, run by Adam and his team.",
      "And we move about 20 of the barrels out of West Texas, about 30 of the barrels that are produced in the United States go through our pipes, over 50 in the Bakken.",
      "We're one of the largest deliverers of barrels to the refineries around Port Arthur and then, of course, Bayou Bridge to the Lake Charles and St. James, and then on and so forth, up the Mid-Continent.",
      "Then you jump over to the NGLs and the massive pipelines we've built with Mariner and we are the company to go to with any ethane, propane growth out of the Northeast through our Marcus Hook terminal.",
      "And then, of course, our incredible expansion at Nederland that we're also completing our next 250,000 in our NGL world where we move a lot of barrels, over 1 million barrels a day go into that.",
      "Very excited about that.",
      "And of course, midstream.",
      "We've got a big presence in the Permian and a lot of other places.",
      "And then you look at what's going on in the pipeline -- our intrastate, our interstate and how well we've built all those out from all the major basins, delivering to all the major markets, whether it's LNG or whether it's power plants or the utilities or cities or whatever, we just have positioned ourselves in such a good way to where if one segment slows down or whatever, the other one picks it back up.",
      "So all that saying, going to your question, yes, we are seeing a slowdown a little bit over the last few weeks.",
      "We actually have been in conversations, Tom and I have, with some of the majors.",
      "They really haven't indicated at these kind of 50 barrel of pricing that necessarily going to slow down.",
      "But we have seen even in the last day, yesterday and today, there's been some statements on slowdown.",
      "We're well positioned to manage that.",
      "This is what happens in this industry.",
      "It will slow down",
      "and then it will come back as a barn burner.",
      "We certainly anticipate that happening with oil but even tenfold on gas.",
      "Any kind of slowdown on gas, if you look over the next 3 or 4 years, 5 to 7 Bcf of growth in the LNG market, who knows where the AI data center and power plants are going to go on a high side or even a medium side on that.",
      "I mean, it's just a wonderful outlook for our pipeline business, both intra and interstate.",
      "So yes, there's areas where drilling has slowed down.",
      "It will slow down some parts of that.",
      "But as a whole, we think some of the other areas of our well-balanced partnership will kind of even things out and we just stay very positive and bullish on the future, especially around NGLs and natural gas transportation.",
      "Jeremy Tonet Got you.",
      "Makes sense.",
      "Yes, I know it's certainly important to have a diversified platform there.",
      "It seems like a slowdown in oil could help the gas supply demand dynamics and could help you out there as well.",
      "And maybe just building a gas a bit more, I guess, the opportunity set as you see it to service growing power demand in data centers even and thinking particularly to the west of Texas, just wondering how you see, I guess, the opportunity set to feed more power in Texas or data centers and also further West in Arizona as well.",
      "Marshall McCrea Yes.",
      "I'll tell you, this is one of those areas where we feel like we're sitting on a gold mine.",
      "As I just mentioned, we built a lot of assets, bought a lot of pipeline assets, moving molecules from production basins to markets.",
      "We wake up here over the last 6 to 12 months and find ourselves in an incredible position.",
      "Adam and his team are -- you got a really good team he's put together to chase deals all over Texas.",
      "There's 150 approximate data centers that we're looking at just in Texas alone, we would love to elaborate and talk about some significant progress we make.",
      "We do believe in the next four to six weeks, we'll be able to make some significant announcements.",
      "But what's really cool about our assets, and we've said this before, is that if we were going to go out and develop.",
      "And we're kind of doing this to a certain degree to help some of the hyperscalers and try to place some of these data centers.",
      "We place them almost right on top of our pipes.",
      "In fact, like we said last time, CloudBurst location, our pipeline actually runs through that acreage.",
      "But we're so well positioned from an electrical transmission standpoint, a lot of the major electric lines running through Texas parallel or very close to our pipelines.",
      "A lot of the low latency fiber optics runs in the same quarter as our pipeline.",
      "So we're very optimistic.",
      "We'd love to elaborate.",
      "Yes, even outside of Texas, we see Arizona as a very significant growth area for data centers, really growth area for natural gas demand in addition to data centers elsewhere in other states call from other states, we expect to make some significant announcements over the next four to eight weeks.",
      "So a little premature, but very excited about where that's going to take us and couldn't be couldn't feel better about our situation on where our pipeline sit.",
      "Our ability to move large volumes through these large diameter systems in the storage, we have to back up that.",
      "We just couldn't be more excited about these opportunities we're chasing.",
      "Jeremy Tonet Got it.",
      "We'll be listening in the coming weeks for that announcement.",
      "Operator Jean Ann Salisbury, Bank of America.",
      "Jean Ann Salisbury Thank you for the update on the timing of the ethane and propane in service for the Nederland Flexport expansion that starts in the next few months.",
      "Can you speak to how you're viewing the speed of the ramp for that project?",
      "And if you expect it to mainly be shipping propane or ethane in the medium term?",
      "Marshall McCrea Yes, this is Mackie again.",
      "I believe we're coming on the end of this month, early next month with ethane.",
      "Regardless of what everybody is hearing about all the negativity around what's going on in China and other areas, we're not having a problem finding a home for our product or ethane or LPG.",
      "In fact, we did a deal this morning for another ethane spot cargo to China.",
      "So with those tariffs apparently being method around ethane and possibly LPG, we feel very good about it.",
      "July or August, we'll be ramping up the propane portion of that.",
      "And then by the end of this year, ethylene.",
      "All of that, we expect on a spot basis and or some of it's turned up to stay very full for the second half of this year.",
      "And then we're on this new flexible expansion, we're over 90 sold out under 3- to 5-year agreement starting January 1 of '26.",
      "So we're very excited about that.",
      "It needs to come online for the international demand around the world.",
      "And we're excited to finally for all that hundreds of millions of dollars were spent, we're excited about the revenue that we're about to bring in the door.",
      "Jean Ann Salisbury Great.",
      "That's super helpful.",
      "And then you kind of touched on this, but my follow-up was just real time what you're seeing in the LPG export market.",
      "Is there basically enough ring rerouting, I guess, going on to avoid the China tariff on US LPG.",
      "And how do you think that plays out in the next few months?",
      "Marshall McCrea Yes.",
      "With all these questions, a lot of uncertainty about what's going on in the industry.",
      "We have very little concern, even talking to our team today, as I just said, there's a lot of international demand, not just China, all over the world for ethane, propane and butane, and we really don't expect to see any major challenges if any challenges at all selling out our terminal every month, the rest of this year.",
      "Operator Spiro Dounis, Citi.",
      "Spiro Dounis",
      "Maybe just to go to Hugh Brinson, Tom, you pointed out that negotiations now are well in excess of that Phase 2 capacity.",
      "So multipart question here.",
      "One, what does that mean for the timing of Phase 2?",
      "Is there an ability to accelerate that now?",
      "And does this actually create some bottlenecks, maybe even downstream of Hugh Brinson where that could precipitate more expansions?",
      "And then lastly, what kind of customers are you dealing with here?",
      "Is this largely data center-driven demand?",
      "Marshall McCrea Yes.",
      "This is Mackie again, Spiro.",
      "I tell you, it's funny we've been trying to get a 42-inch across Texas FID for, I don't even know, 4 or 5 years, and we finally got that done, and it couldn't have been better timing, especially larger last question was related data centers.",
      "However, getting that to FID had nothing to do with data centers, not one data center supported that project to get it off the ground.",
      "As we've said, we have sold out now Phase 1.",
      "We are in negotiations with -- I wouldn't say twice as much, but significantly more volume request and we have capacity available to take it from 1.5 Bcf to 2.2 Bcf.",
      "But as I was just alluding to what an incredible time to announce a new 42-inch, 2.2 Bcf pipeline out of the most prolific basin in the United States that connects to multiple 42- and 36-inch pipes of ours that feeds markets throughout the state of Texas and then also, of course, accesses Carthage and tax owed to feed the Southeast, LNG, everything else.",
      "So we're very excited about that.",
      "And then as far as data centers, we call it kind of the gold rush.",
      "It's something where not only is it -- are we working with customers that we will end up probably utilizing some of the remainder capacity we have available.",
      "We also have customers that want diversification of receipt points, meaning they may want some from Waha, some from Katy, some from Carthage.",
      "We're able to accommodate that with this massive system we've built.",
      "So we're in such a good situation very excited about.",
      "As I keep saying, we can't express our excitement enough and one kind of exclamation point on this.",
      "Tying in all these, it's not just data centers.",
      "That's one thing that we probably need to elaborate on.",
      "We're negotiating with as many power plants unassociated with data centers that we think are more likely to happen just because of the need, especially here in Texas to meet the growing demand from population, et cetera.",
      "So kind of the exclamation point is there's not a lot of capital to this.",
      "As I mentioned earlier, a lot of these areas where these data centers are proposed are right on top of us.",
      "So we're talking about moving 250,000, 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 in different directions with some good healthy margins and yet we're laying a mile of -- 5 miles of pipe.",
      "So it's exciting enough time.",
      "I'll say it again, we're thrilled with this new opportunity for our pipeline assets and very excited where that's going to take revenues for those assets in the future.",
      "Spiro Dounis",
      "It's great to hear, Mackie.",
      "Second question, maybe this one for you as well.",
      "And I kind of want to go back to Jeremy's original question.",
      "Ask it a different way and hopefully not make you repeat yourself.",
      "Your point is well taken.",
      "I think over longer-term periods, you've proven to be pretty durable and resilient duty cycles.",
      "I guess we narrow the focus a little bit.",
      "Obviously, a lot of projects coming online this year, 5 billion of CapEx in the hopper here.",
      "And I think last time we caught up, it did suggest you'd be sort of at the higher end of your sort of 3 to 5 growth rate this year and maybe next year.",
      "And so I guess I'm curious, given everything we've seen, I realize a lot of uncertainty still, crude in the 50s.",
      "There's still feel like that 5 billion of CapEx is got enough hardwired growth inside of it to still drive 5 growth or maybe some of that come off a bit.",
      "Marshall McCrea That's a good question.",
      "And certainly, we're always looking at everything.",
      "Every impact we might have on our system with some of the statements that have come out even recently, one thing we were joking about before this call is every time we bring on a plant, we just brought on Lenora 1 here not too long ago within days.",
      "Certainly within weeks, it's full.",
      "And so when we bring on Lenora 2 here in the next 30, 45 days, we don't know how full it's going to be.",
      "Our expectations are, it's going to fill up pretty fast.",
      "But we do have the luxury of kind of watching what happens over the next quarter, maybe 1.5 quarters, 2 quarters.",
      "And if we really do see a slowdown, we will have the ability to defer some of these costs.",
      "We can delay Mustang draw, certainly not talk about -- think about that or anything right now on that.",
      "but it's certainly a tool and something that we can look at as well as other projects that we have.",
      "If we see a huge downturn and it's extended for some period of time, we will be able to push some of that 5 billion into 26 billion.",
      "But way premature to any kind of that type of -- I wouldn't say panic, but any of that type of moves.",
      "We remain bullish",
      "Yes, we see some softening.",
      "Yes, we see some potential challenges over the next quarter or two.",
      "But a year, 2 years through 10 years, we're extremely bullish on our industry and on the need for all the products that we transport.",
      "And we'll just see how the next quarter plays out before we make some of those decisions.",
      "Operator Keith Stanley, Wolfe Research.",
      "Keith Stanley Two follow-ups on that.",
      "So on the CapEx conversation, Tom, is there a figure that you have just roughly, if we're talking 5 billion of growth CapEx this year.",
      "What would that look like based on just sanctioned projects right now for 2026?",
      "Does that number come down a lot?",
      "Or how are you looking at that and flexibility for '26 spend?",
      "Thomas Long Yes, Keith.",
      "That's actually a very good question.",
      "Of course, we generally don't give our guidance for the current year until the end of the year.",
      "But when you really look out and you probably look at a lot of these projects that we're talking about coming on right now, we don't have that same size number currently filled up.",
      "But we do have, as always, a big backlog of projects to look at.",
      "So I don't really have an answer for you on how to guide.",
      "But probably take it to less than half of that is probably where I would take it with you, Keith.",
      "So let's see how the year continues to develop.",
      "But as we sit here right now, that's probably a good marker without it being guidance, though.",
      "Keith Stanley Okay.",
      "So less than half of the 5 billion is sanctioned today, and obviously, that can change over time.",
      "Thomas Long",
      "That's inaudible Keith Stanley Okay.",
      "That's very helpful.",
      "The second follow-up, I just wanted to check on the contracting position just across NGL exports.",
      "And so I think, Mackie, you said you expect to fully sell out on a spot basis, all of your available export capacity.",
      "We also said Flexport is 90 contracted for 3 to 5 years.",
      "Just looking holistically at your NGL export portfolio, is there a percentage of capacity that you would point to as being under fixed fee contracts going forward, including Flexport?",
      "Marshall McCrea Yes, Keith.",
      "So our spot prices, they're fixed when we negotiate each month.",
      "And then our term prices, they are fixed.",
      "So all the -- whether it's a three-year or four-year or five-year term, it's a fixed fee for us to load ethane, propane or butane onto these ships.",
      "Does that answer your question?",
      "Keith Stanley",
      "I guess I was trying to get at what percentage the mix?",
      "So what percentage is term contracts versus kind of month-to-month?",
      "Marshall McCrea So the Flexport project that we're bringing on ethane and propane and then ethylene throughout the remainder of this year, fully contracted fixed price on average three to five years for the Flexport capacity that we're putting in service this year.",
      "Operator Michael Blum, Wells Fargo.",
      "Michael Blum I had a follow-up question on Hugh Brinson.",
      "So it sounds like you have more demand than your Phase 2 expansion.",
      "So I guess the question is, could you expand it further with compression?",
      "Or do you have another option?",
      "Would you somehow need to add another pipeline?",
      "And the other question related to that is, does this give you more pricing power and the ability to charge higher rates?",
      "Or could you see a higher return on a project like that?",
      "Marshall McCrea Well, let me just say our prices are always fair and competitive.",
      "We may have some markets on the phone.",
      "But no, anything like that, of course, we can always look pipe.",
      "We can always add compression.",
      "We actually now are looking at making Hugh Brinson fully bidirectional that's at a relatively inexpensive price to make that work.",
      "But I guess to kind of round out the answer, we feel really good about the value of the capacity that we have yet to sell on Hugh Brinson and the amount of revenues that's going to create for our partnership, both from a west-to-east route as well as from an east to west out across Texas.",
      "So as I mentioned, we're very well positioned and we think we're going to do very well on adding significant value with all of these, not only data centers but with all the power plant opportunities that we have, not only in Texas, but in a number of other states.",
      "Operator Manav Gupta, UBS.",
      "Manav Gupta I wanted to ask you, it's been about six months since you have had a new President and a new government.",
      "Have things actually changed on the ground?",
      "Are you seeing more supportive permitting process?",
      "And in general, are you seeing more support for oil and gas industry from the new administration?",
      "Marshall McCrea Yes, absolutely.",
      "We didn't expect it to be this big of an impact on things yet.",
      "But long term, we think the decisions that this administration will be very good for our country and very good for our industry and very good for our partnership.",
      "In regards to permitting, it goes without saying that the pause around LNG, whatever pause there was left has been lifted the energy dominance Council under the Department of Interior is doing everything they can to learn about projects and to help projects get to the finish line where they make sense.",
      "As far as any extensions, for example, around our LNG project with FERC extensions or DOE extensions, we feel very good about getting those.",
      "So general overall statement is things are much more positive.",
      "We think it will become much easier to build infrastructure with a lot more certainty for ourselves and for our customers and for the country.",
      "So as we talked about for the last four years, we are very excited about this new administration and where it's going to take this country and how our partnership will benefit from it.",
      "Manav Gupta Perfect.",
      "My quick and easy follow-up here is your guidance still remains for 2025, 16.1 to 16.5 .",
      "And those of us really like ET, hope it's 16.5 .",
      "Help us understand, despite some of the small slowdowns that you are seeing, what could still get you closer to 16.5 versus the midpoint of the guidance?",
      "Dylan Bramhall Yes.",
      "This is Dylan here.",
      "So when we think about that guidance range.",
      "One thing I do want to point out is before I start here, we put out this range.",
      "We put out this range of 400 million, and that's on at a midpoint of 16.3 billion.",
      "So if you think about that from the midpoint to the high and the low end, we're only going at less than 1.25 each way.",
      "So that's a pretty tight range.",
      "There's a lot of drivers in there.",
      "We feel really good about this plan when we put it out, and we still feel really good about it right now.",
      "It's the usual things, commodity price movements, spreads, those make up about 10 of our business there.",
      "And then there's a little bit of volume exposure as well within primarily the midstream segment.",
      "That's fairly muted as well.",
      "But those are really the drivers that can move us within that 2.5 range top to bottom end.",
      "Operator John Mackay, Goldman Sachs.",
      "John Mackay I wanted to talk about WTG for a second.",
      "It's been about, I guess, three quarters since you guys closed on that.",
      "Just anything you can kind of update us on in terms of how that asset is going right now, your ability to kind of ramp it up and start to retake share in the Midland.",
      "And then anything that's coming out of it on the NGL side that's given you some confidence on the contracting piece on the TMS side.",
      "Marshall McCrea",
      "This is Mackie.",
      "I'll start and Dylan may want to follow up.",
      "But what a great acquisition, a tremendous amount of reserve and contracts dedicated to those assets.",
      "We have discovered as we've kind of started operating on some issues that have come up that we continue to address.",
      "But long term, we're excited about the growth, both from a cryogenic, from a gathering standpoint, but also from a downstream.",
      "We mentioned Hugh Brinson.",
      "Hugh Brinson will be at the tailgate of the majority of the WTG cryos that'd be a great outlet when there's issues.",
      "We are having issues from time to time with the existing pipeline.",
      "So that will help in a big way.",
      "But as well as the NGLs, some of the NGLs are already dedicated.",
      "We do see growth in NGLs coming from these facilities in the future for our NGL pipeline in fracking business.",
      "But all in all, we're very pleased about that asset and working hard to bring it up to the full standards of energy transfers, other assets.",
      "And it's going to be a great contributor to our partnership for many years to come.",
      "Dylan Bramhall Yes.",
      "inaudible I think when we look back versus our acquisition plan, as many of you recall, had a lot of maintenance inaudible maintenance capital in for the first years as we recognized there was going to be some work to do",
      "and we're definitely spending that capital.",
      "But on the plus side, the volumes are volumes are ahead of the plan that we had an acquisition.",
      "And so I think we're really pleased the producers behind the system are great partners, and we're seeing the financial benefits of that on the revenue side.",
      "So all in all, financially, this is going to turn out to be a great acquisition for us.",
      "John Mackay I appreciate that.",
      "And second, I want to be quick.",
      "Dylan, just going back to Manav's question on the guidance, not to belabor the point.",
      "But since the range is so tight, I just want to ask the 160 million benefit in midstream this quarter?",
      "Was that kind of expected inside the guide?",
      "And then how are you guys treating the remainder storm proceeds that you haven't recognized yet relative to that guidance range?",
      "Dylan Bramhall Yes.",
      "I would say that wasn't explicitly as part of the guide now.",
      "When we look at the guide, the one thing that somewhat offsets that is the first quarter in our guide we've assumed internally some volatility in there that we capture in the intrastate segment.",
      "I'll say, this first quarter, we did not have the volatility that we've seen in past years.",
      "And so we were short on that mark there.",
      "So this is a little bit of an offset there versus some stretch that we put into the business in the first quarter.",
      "So kind of consider that a wash as we go forward here.",
      "Operator Gabe Moreen, Mizuho.",
      "Gabriel Moreen I just had one follow-up on Lake Charles.",
      "Given, I guess, all the activity to try to get gas to the Gulf Coast for LNG exports and also the mid-ocean agreement saying that they'll use energy transfer pipes to get gas to their portion of the facility.",
      "Can you calibrate kind of the upstream opportunities on the pipe side now that you're getting close to FID, whether it's getting gas from the Haynesville across the border from Texas, just kind of your latest thoughts on how big that opportunity could be?",
      "Marshall McCrea You bet.",
      "This is Mackie again.",
      "It's a huge opportunity.",
      "Yes, we do intend for all the molecules that come in Lake Charles will -- were somehow moved through our pipelines.",
      "We have the ability to move quite a bit of gas in that area today.",
      "We will be needing to expand where exactly that expansion will come to and what size and timing and all that, we're still working through that depending on what the customers' desires are, but probably unlike any other we will have the ability to source from the Permian Basin, from cartridge, from Oklahoma, from Perryville, from North Louisiana, from East Texas, from Katy.",
      "So with our extensive pipeline interstate network, we're having the ability to provide our customers and ourselves with access to the cheapest sources of supply, wherever those may be from all those points we just talked about.",
      "So we're still fine-tuning and finalizing what additional upstream pipelines will be necessary and those will be also to FID by the end of this year as well in conjunction with the Lake Charles.",
      "Operator This concludes our question-and-answer session.",
      "I'd like to turn the conference back over to Tom Long for closing remarks.",
      "Thomas Long Well, thank you.",
      "And thank you to all of you for joining us.",
      "We're always very, very appreciative of your support, and we look forward to any follow-up questions you might have.",
      "Operator Thank you.",
      "This concludes today's conference call.",
      "We thank you all for attending today's presentation.",

He's stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year. However, the legendary investor has another secret that many don't know about: a portfolio of stocks that doesn't appear on Berkshire's regulatory filings.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway acquired General Re in 1998, which had bought New England Asset Management (NEAM) three years earlier. This deal gave Buffett a \"secret portfolio\" often overlooked by investors.\n\nBut if you're seeking great income opportunities, you can find plenty among NEAM's holdings. Some of the stocks offer exceptionally juicy dividends. Here are the smartest high-yield dividend stocks in Buffett's \"secret portfolio\" to buy right now.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Ares Capital\n\nNEAM owns 225,900 shares of Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC), giving Buffett an indirect stake in the largest publicly traded business development company (BDC). Savvy income investors know that BDCs often provide attractive dividend yields because the companies must return at least 90% of their earnings to shareholders as dividends to be exempt from federal income taxes.\n\nI think Ares Capital has the best dividend program in the BDC industry. Its forward dividend yield is an ultra-high 9.12%. Ares has paid stable or increasing dividends for 63 consecutive quarters. The company has also delivered the highest base dividend growth over the last 10 years of any externally managed BDC with a market cap of over $700 million.\n\nAres Capital could even appeal to investors who aren't primarily focused on income. Since its initial public offering in 2004, the stock has delivered a 70% greater cumulative total return than the S&P 500 and an average annual total return of 13%.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve concerned about stagflation, could Ares Capital's business suffer over the near term? Maybe. However, CEO Kort Schnabel believes his company could increase its market share in direct lending. BDCs such as Ares Capital could also be more attractive to middle-market businesses as banks reduce their risk exposure.\n\n2. Duke Energy\n\nUtility stocks tend to be great safe havens for investors during turbulent periods. Buffett's \"secret portfolio\" owns several solid utility stocks. I think Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) is the best of the bunch. The company provides electricity to 8.6 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio. It also operates natural gas utilities that serve 1.7 million customers in the Carolinas, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee.",

Berkshire Hathaway acquired General Re in 1998, which had bought New England Asset Management NEAM three years earlier. This deal gave Buffett a \"secret portfolio\" often overlooked by investors. But if you're seeking great income opportunities, you can find plenty among NEAM's holdings. Some of the stocks offer exceptionally juicy dividends. Here are the smartest high-yield dividend stocks in Buffett's \"secret portfolio\" to buy right now. Image source: The Motley Fool. 1. Ares Capital NEAM owns 225,900 shares of Ares Capital NASDAQ: ARCC , giving Buffett an indirect stake in the largest publicly traded business development company BDC . Savvy income investors know that BDCs often provide attractive dividend yields because the companies must return at least 90 of their earnings to shareholders as dividends to be exempt from federal income taxes. I think Ares Capital has the best dividend program in the BDC industry. Its forward dividend yield is an ultra-high 9.12 . Ares has paid stable or increasing dividends for 63 consecutive quarters. The company has also delivered the highest base dividend growth over the last 10 years of any externally managed BDC with a market cap of over 700 million. Ares Capital could even appeal to investors who aren't primarily focused on income. Since its initial public offering in 2004, the stock has delivered a 70 greater cumulative total return than the S P 500 and an average annual total return of 13 . With the Federal Reserve concerned about stagflation, could Ares Capital's business suffer over the near term? Maybe. However, CEO Kort Schnabel believes his company could increase its market share in direct lending. BDCs such as Ares Capital could also be more attractive to middle-market businesses as banks reduce their risk exposure. 2. Duke Energy Utility stocks tend to be great safe havens for investors during turbulent periods. Buffett's \"secret portfolio\" owns several solid utility stocks. I think Duke Energy NYSE: DUK is the best of the bunch. The company provides electricity to 8.6 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio. It also operates natural gas utilities that serve 1.7 million customers in the Carolinas, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee.",

It has sold off higher-cost assets and recycled the capital to expand its lower-cost resources. The result is an oil company that can produce a lot of cash at lower oil prices.\n\nThat was on full display during the first quarter. Meanwhile, with further improvements in its cash flow ahead, the oil stock will become an even more efficient cash-producing machine.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nDrilling down into ConocoPhillips' first-quarter report\n\nConocoPhillips produced an average of nearly 2.4 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day during the first quarter. That was an increase of 487,000 BOE per day from the prior-year period, fueled largely by its acquisition of Marathon Oil. However, even after adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and asset sales, its production was up 5% from the year-ago period due to its investments to grow its output in low-cost regions.\n\nThat higher production enabled ConocoPhillips to generate $5.5 billion of cash from operations during the period. It used that money to help fund $3.4 billion of capital expenditures and investments to maintain and grow its production. The oil company used its free cash flow and strong balance sheet to repurchase $1.5 billion of its shares and pay $1 billion in dividends. The company also retired $500 million of debt at maturity.\n\nThe oil giant ended the period with $7.5 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet and another $1 billion in long-term investments. It enhanced its balance sheet by repaying debt and selling $1.3 billion of noncore assets to maintain a strong cash position.\n\nFlexing its efficiency muscles in 2025\n\n\"Amid a volatile macro environment, we remain confident in the competitive advantages provided by our differentiated portfolio, strong balance sheet, and disciplined capital allocation framework that prioritizes returns on and of capital to shareholders,\" stated CEO Ryan Lance in the first-quarter earnings press release. The company's strong competitive position enables it to operate even more efficiently this year. ConocoPhillips is reducing its full-year capital and operating cost guidance while maintaining its production outlook.\n\nConocoPhillips now expects its capital spending to be in the range of $12.3 billion-$12.6 billion, down from $12.9 billion. It's also lowering its adjusted operating cost guidance range from $10.9 billion-$11.1 billion to $10.7 billion-$10.9 billion. Despite reducing spending, the company still expects to produce between 2.3 million and 2.4 million BOE per day this year. That puts the company in a position to produce more free cash flow at the current oil price point than it would have had in its prior outlook.",

      "Drilling down into ConocoPhillips' first-quarter report ConocoPhillips produced an average of nearly 2.4 million barrels of oil equivalent BOE per day during the first quarter.",
      "That was an increase of 487,000 BOE per day from the prior-year period, fueled largely by its acquisition of Marathon Oil.",
      "However, even after adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and asset sales, its production was up 5 from the year-ago period due to its investments to grow its output in low-cost regions.",
      "That higher production enabled ConocoPhillips to generate 5.5 billion of cash from operations during the period.",
      "It used that money to help fund 3.4 billion of capital expenditures and investments to maintain and grow its production.",
      "The oil company used its free cash flow and strong balance sheet to repurchase 1.5 billion of its shares and pay 1 billion in dividends.",
      "The company also retired 500 million of debt at maturity.",
      "The oil giant ended the period with 7.5 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet and another 1 billion in long-term investments.",
      "It enhanced its balance sheet by repaying debt and selling 1.3 billion of noncore assets to maintain a strong cash position.",
      "Flexing its efficiency muscles in 2025 \"Amid a volatile macro environment, we remain confident in the competitive advantages provided by our differentiated portfolio, strong balance sheet, and disciplined capital allocation framework that prioritizes returns on and of capital to shareholders,\" stated CEO Ryan Lance in the first-quarter earnings press release.",
      "The company's strong competitive position enables it to operate even more efficiently this year.",
      "ConocoPhillips is reducing its full-year capital and operating cost guidance while maintaining its production outlook.",
      "ConocoPhillips now expects its capital spending to be in the range of 12.3 billion- 12.6 billion, down from 12.9 billion.",
      "It's also lowering its adjusted operating cost guidance range from 10.9 billion- 11.1 billion to 10.7 billion- 10.9 billion.",
      "Despite reducing spending, the company still expects to produce between 2.3 million and 2.4 million BOE per day this year.",
      "That puts the company in a position to produce more free cash flow at the current oil price point than it would have had in its prior outlook."

      "Q: How is the acquisition of the three US utilities performing, and is the 2025 guidance conservative given the strong start to the year?",
